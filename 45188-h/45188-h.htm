<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>As soon as Armistice was declared in the recent
World War, I began to take up the study of the International
Development of China, and to form programs
accordingly. I was prompted to do so by the desire
to contribute my humble part in the realization of world
peace. China, a country possessing a territory of
4,289,000 square miles, a population of 400,000,000
people, and the richest mineral and agricultural resources
in the world, is now a prey of militaristic and
capitalistic powers&mdash;a greater bone of contention than
the Balkan Peninsula. Unless the Chinese question
can be settled peacefully, another world war greater
and more terrible than the one just past will be inevitable.
In order to solve the Chinese question, I suggest
that the vast resources of China be developed internationally
under a socialistic scheme, for the good of the
world in general and the Chinese people in particular.
It is my hope that as a result of this, the present spheres
of influence can be abolished; the international commercial
war can be done away with; the internecine
capitalistic competition can be got rid of, and last, but
not least, the class struggle between capital and labor
can be avoided. Thus the root of war will be forever
exterminated so far as China is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Each part of the different programs in this International
Scheme, is but a rough sketch or a general
policy produced from a layman's thought with very
limited materials at his disposal. So alterations and
changes will have to be made after scientific investigation
and detailed survey. For instance, in regard to
the projected Great Northern Port, which is to be
situated between the mouths of the Tsingho and the
Lwanho, the writer thought that the entrance of the
harbor should be at the eastern side of the port but
from actual survey by technical engineers, it is found
that the entrance of the harbor should be at the western
side of the port instead. So I crave great indulgence
on the part of experts and specialists.</p>

<p>I wish to thank Dr. Monlin Chiang, Mr. David Yui,
Dr. Y.&nbsp;Y. Tsu, Mr. T.&nbsp;Z. Koo, and Dr. John Y. Lee,
who have given me great assistance in reading over the
manuscripts with me.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">A Project to Assist the Readjustment of
Post-Bellum Industries</span></span></h2>

<p>It is estimated that during the last year of the World
War the daily expenses of the various fighting nations
amounted to two hundred and forty millions of dollars
gold. It is accepted by even the most conservative,
that only one half of this sum was spent on munitions
and other direct war supplies, that is, one hundred and
twenty millions of dollars gold. Let us consider these
war supplies from a commercial point of view. The
battlefield is the market for these new industries, the
consumers of which are the soldiers. Various industries
had to be enlisted and many new ones created for
the supplies. In order to increase the production of
these war commodities day by day, people of the warring
countries and even those of the neutral states had
to be content with the barest necessities of life and had
to give up all former comforts and luxuries.</p>

<p>Now the war is ended and the sole market of these
war supplies has closed, let us hope, forever, for the
good of humanity. So, from now on we are concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
with the problem as to how a readjustment may be
brought about. What must be considered first is the
reconstruction of the various countries, and next the
supply of comforts and luxuries that will have to be
resumed. We remember that one hundred and twenty
million dollars were spent every day on direct war
supplies. Let us then suppose that the two items mentioned
will take up one half of this sum, that is, sixty
millions of dollars a day which will still leave us a
balance of sixty million dollars a day. Besides, the
many millions of soldiers who were once consumers will
from now on become producers again. Furthermore,
the unification and nationalization of all the industries,
which I might call the Second Industrial Revolution,
will be more far-reaching than that of the first one in
which Manual Labor was displaced by Machinery.
This second industrial revolution will increase the productive
power of man many times more than the first
one. Consequently, this unification and nationalization
of industries on account of the World War will further
complicate the readjustment of the post-war industries.
Just imagine sixty million dollars a day or twenty-one
billions and nine hundred millions of dollars a year of
new trade created by the war suddenly have to stop
when peace is concluded! Where in this world can
Europe and America look for a market to consume
this enormous saving from the war?</p>

<p>If the billions of dollars worth of war industries
can find no place in the post-bellum readjustment, then
they will be a pure economic waste. The result will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
not only disturb the economic condition of the producing
countries, but will also be a great loss to the
world at large.</p>

<p>All the commercial nations are looking to China as
the only "dumping ground" for their over-production.
The pre-war condition of trade was unfavorable to
China. The balance of imports over exports was something
over one hundred million dollars gold annually.
The market of China under this condition could not
expand much for soon after there will be no more
money or commodities left for exchanging goods with
foreign countries. Fortunately, the natural resources
of China are great and their proper development would
create an unlimited market for the whole world and
would utilize the greater part, if not all of the billions
of dollars worth of war industries soon to be turned
into peace industries.</p>

<p>China is the land that still employs manual labor for
production and has not yet entered the first stage of
industrial evolution, while in Europe and America the
second stage is already reached. So China has to begin
the two stages of industrial evolution at once by adopting
the machinery as well as the nationalization of
production. In this case China will require machinery
for her vast agriculture, machinery for her rich mines,
machinery for the building of her innumerable factories,
machinery for her extensive transportation
systems and machinery for all her public utilities. Let
us see how this new demand for machinery will help
in the readjustment of war industries. The workshops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
that turn out cannon can easily be made to turn out
steam rollers for the construction of roads in China.
The workshops that turn out tanks can be made to turn
out trucks for the transportation of the raw materials
that are lying everywhere in China. And all sorts of
warring machinery can be converted into peaceful
tools for the general development of China's latent
wealth. The Chinese people will welcome the development
of our country's resources provided that it can
be kept out of Mandarin corruption and ensure the
mutual benefit of China and of the countries coöperating
with us.</p>

<p>It might be feared by some people in Europe and
America that the development of China by war
machinery, war organization and technical experts
might create unfavorable competition to foreign industries.
I, therefore, propose a scheme to develop a new
market in China big enough both for her own products
and for products from foreign countries. The scheme
will be along the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I. The Development of a Communications System.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) 100,000 miles of Railways.</p>

<p>(b) 1,000,000 miles of Macadam Roads.</p>

<p>(c) Improvement of Existing Canals.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Hangchow-Tientsin Canals.</p>

<p>(2) Sikiang-Yangtze Canals.</p></blockquote>

<p>(d) Construction of New Canals.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Liaoho-Sunghwakiang Canal.</p>

<p>(2) Others to be projected.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>
<p>(e) River Conservancy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) To regulate the Embankments and
Channel of the Yangtze River from
Hankow to the Sea thus facilitating
Ocean-going Ships to reach
that port at all seasons.</p>

<p>(2) To regulate the Hoangho Embankments
and Channel to prevent
floods.</p>

<p>(3) To regulate the Sikiang.</p>

<p>(4) To regulate the Hwaiho.</p>

<p>(5) To regulate various other rivers.</p></blockquote>

<p>(f) The Construction of more Telegraph
Lines and Telephone and Wireless Systems
all over the Country.</p></blockquote>

<p>II. The Development of Commercial Harbors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) Three largest Ocean Ports with future
capacity equalling New York Harbor to
be constructed in North, Central and
South China.</p>

<p>(b) Various small Commercial and Fishing
Harbors to be constructed along the Coast.</p>

<p>(c) Commercial Docks to be constructed along
all navigable rivers.</p></blockquote>

<p>III. Modern Cities with public utilities to be constructed
in all Railway Centers, Termini and alongside
Harbors.</p>

<p>IV. Water Power Development.</p>

<p>V. Iron and Steel Works and Cement Works on
the largest scale in order to supply the above needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
VI. Mineral Development.</p>

<p>VII. Agricultural Development.</p>

<p>VIII. Irrigational Work on the largest scale in
Mongolia and Sinkiang.</p>

<p>IX. Reforestation in Central and North China.</p>

<p>X. Colonization in Manchuria, Mongolia, Sinkiang,
Kokonor, and Thibaut.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the above program could be carried out gradually,
China will not only be the "Dumping Ground" for
foreign goods but actually will be the "Economic
Ocean" capable of absorbing all the surplus capital as
quickly as the Industrial Nations can possibly produce
by the coming Industrial Revolution of Nationalized
Productive Machinery. Then there will be no more
competition and commercial struggles in China as well
as in the world.</p>

<p>The recent World War has proved to Mankind that
war is ruinous to both the Conqueror and the Conquered,
and worse for the Aggressor. What is true in
military warfare is more so in trade warfare. Since
President Wilson has proposed a League of Nations to
end military war in the future, I desire to propose to
end the trade war by coöperation and mutual help in the
Development of China. This will root out probably the
greatest cause of future wars.</p>

<p>The world has been greatly benefited by the development
of America as an industrial and a commercial
Nation. So a developed China with her four hundred
millions of population, will be another New World in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the economic sense. The nations which will take part
in this development will reap immense advantages.
Furthermore, international coöperation of this kind
cannot but help to strengthen the Brotherhood of Man.
Ultimately, I am sure, this will culminate to be the
keystone in the arch of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>In order to carry out this project successfully I
suggest that three necessary steps must be taken:
First, that the various Governments of the Capital-supplying
Powers must agree to joint action and a unified
policy to form an International Organization with
their war work organizers, administrators and experts
of various lines to formulate plans and to standardize
materials in order to prevent waste and to facilitate
work. Second, the confidence of the Chinese people
must be secured in order to gain their coöperation and
enthusiastic support. If the above two steps are
accomplished, then the third step is to open formal
negotiation for the final contract of the project with
the Chinese Government. For which I suggest that it
be on the same basis as the contract I once concluded
with the Pauling Company of London, for the construction
of the Canton-Chungking Railway, since it
was the fairest to both parties and the one most welcomed
by the Chinese people, of all contracts that were
ever made between China and the foreign countries.</p>

<p>And last but not least, a warning must be given that
mistakes such as the notorious Sheng Shun Hwai's
nationalized Railway Scheme in 1911 must not be committed
again. In those days foreign bankers entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
disregarded the will of the Chinese people, and thought
that they could do everything with the Chinese Government
alone. But to their regret, they found that the
contracts which they had concluded with the Government,
by heavy bribery, were only to be blocked by the
people later on. Had the foreign bankers gone in the
right way of first securing the confidence of the
Chinese people, and then approaching the Government
for a contract, many things might have been accomplished
without a hitch. Therefore, in this International
Project we must pay more attention to the
people's will than ever before.</p>

<p>If my proposition is acceptable to the Capital-supplying
Powers, I will furnish further details.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PROGRAM_I" id="PROGRAM_I">PROGRAM I</a></h2>

<p>The industrial development of China should be
carried out along two lines: (1) by private enterprise
and (2) by national undertaking. All matters that can
be and are better carried out by private enterprise
should be left to private hands which should be encouraged
and fully protected by liberal laws. And in order
to facilitate the industrial development by private
enterprise in China, the hitherto suicidal internal taxes
must be abolished, the cumbersome currency must be
reformed, the various kinds of official obstacles must
be removed, and transportation facilities must be
provided. All matters that cannot be taken up by
private concerns and those that possess monopolistic
character should be taken up as national undertakings.
It is for this latter line of development that we are here
endeavoring to deal with. In this national undertaking,
foreign capital have to be invited, foreign experts
and organizers have to be enlisted, and gigantic methods
have to be adopted. The property thus created will
be state owned and will be managed for the benefit
of the whole nation. During the construction and the
operation of each of these national undertakings,
before its capital and interest are fully repaid, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
be managed and supervised by foreign experts under
Chinese employment. As one of their obligations,
these foreign experts have to undertake the training of
Chinese assistants to take their places in the future.
When the capital and interest of each undertaking are
paid off, the Chinese Government will have the option
to employ either foreigners or Chinese to manage the
concern as it thinks fit.</p>

<p>Before entering into the details of this International
development scheme, four principles have to be considered:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The most remunerative field must be selected
in order to attract foreign capital.</p>

<p>(2) The most urgent needs of the nation must be
met.</p>

<p>(3) The lines of least resistance must be followed.</p>

<p>(4) The most suitable positions must be chosen.</p></blockquote>

<p>In conformity with the above principles, I formulate
<span class="smcap">Program I</span> as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><blockquote class="rmn">

<p><span class="rmn-i">I.</span> The construction of a great Northern Port on
the Gulf of Pechili.</p>

<p><span class="rmn-ii">II.</span> The building of a system of railways from the
Great Northern Port to the Northwestern
extremity of China.</p>

<p><span class="rmn-iii">III.</span> The Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang
(Chinese Turkestan).</p>

<p><span class="rmn-iv">IV.</span> The construction of canals to connect the inland
waterway systems of North and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Central China with the Great Northern
Port.</p>

<p><span class="rmn-v">V.</span> The development of the Iron and Coal fields
in Shansi and the construction of an Iron
and Steel Works.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>These five projects will be worked out as one
program, for each of them will assist and accelerate
the development of the others. The Great Northern
Port will serve as a base of operation of this International
Development Scheme, as well as a connecting
link of transportation and communication between
China and the outer world. The other four projects
will be centered around it.</p>

<h3>PART I<br />

<span class="subhead">The Great Northern Port</span></h3>

<p>I propose that a great deep water and ice free port
be constructed on the Gulf of Pechili. The need of
such a port in that part of China has been keenly felt
for a long time. Several projects have been proposed
such as the deepening of the Taku Bar, the construction
of a harbor in the Chiho estuary, the Chinwangtao
Harbor which has actually been carried out on a small
scale and the Hulutao Harbor which is on the point of
being constructed. But the site of my projected port
is in none of these places for the first two are too far
from the deep water line and too near to fresh water
which freezes in winter. So it is impossible to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
them into deep water and ice free ports, while the last
two are too far away from the center of population and
are unprofitable as commercial ports. The locality of
my projected port is just at midway between Taku and
Chinwangtao and at a point between the mouths of the
Tsingho and Lwanho, on the cape of the coast line
between Taku and Chinwangtao. This is one of the
points nearest to deep water in this Gulf. With the
fresh water of the Tsingho and Lwanho diverted
away, it can be made a deep water and ice free port
without much difficulty. Its distance to Tientsin is
about seventy or eighty miles less than that of Chinwangtao
to Tientsin. Moreover, this port can be
connected with the inland waterway systems of North
and Central China by canal, whereas in the case of
Chinwangtao and Hulutao this could not be done. So
this port is far superior as a commercial harbor than
Hulutao or Chinwangtao which at present is the only
ice free port in the Gulf of Pechili.</p>

<p>From a commercial standpoint this port will be a
paying proposition from the very beginning of its
construction, owing to the fact that it is situated at the
center of the greatest salt industry in China. The
cheapest salt is produced here by sun evaporation only.
If modern methods could be added, also utilizing the
cheap coal near by, the production could increase many
times more and the cost could thus be made cheaper.
Then it can supply the whole of China with much
cheaper salt. By this industry alone it is quite sufficient
to support a moderate sized harbor which must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the first step of this great project. Besides, there is in
the immediate neighborhood the greatest coal mine that
has yet been developed in China, the Kailan Mining
Company. The output of its colliery is about four
million tons a year. At present the company uses
its own harbor, Chinwangtao, for shipping its exports.
But our projected port is much nearer to
its colliery than Chinwangtao. It can be connected
with the mine by canal thus providing it with a
much cheaper carriage than by rail to Chinwangtao.
Furthermore, our projected port will in future consume
much of the Kailan coal. Thus eventually
the Company must use our port as a shipping
stage for its exports. Tientsin, the largest commercial
center in North China, has no deep harbor
and is ice bound several months a year in winter, and
so has to use our projected port entirely as an outlet for
its world trade. This is the local need only but for
this alone it is quite sufficient to make our projected
port a paying proposition.</p>

<p>But my idea is to develop this port as large as New
York in a reasonable limit of time. Now, let us survey
the hinterland to see whether the possibility justifies
my ideal or not. To the southwest are the provinces of
Chili and Shansi, and the Hoangho valley with a
population of nearly a hundred millions. To the northwest
are the undeveloped Jehol district and the vast
Mongolian Prairie with their virgin soil waiting for
development, Chili with its dense population and
Shansi with its rich mineral resources have to depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
upon this port as their only outlet to the sea. And if
the future Dolon Nor and Urga Railway is completed
with connection to the Siberian line then Central
Siberia will also have to use this as its nearest seaport.
Thus its contributing or rather distributing area will
be larger than that of New York. Finally, this port
will become the true terminus of the future Eurasian
Railway System, which will connect the two continents.
The land which we select to be the site of our
projected port is now almost worth next to nothing.
Let us say two or three hundred square miles be
taken up as national property absolutely for our future
city building. If within forty years we could develop
a city as large as Philadelphia, not to say New York,
the land value alone will be sufficient to pay off the
capital invested in its development.</p>

<p>The need of such a port in this part of China goes
without saying. For the provinces of Chili, Shansi,
Western Shantung, Northern Honan, a part of Fengtien
and the greater part of Shensi and Kansu with a
population of about 100 millions are lacking of a seaport
of this kind. Mongolia and Sinkiang as well as
the rich coal and iron fields of Shansi will also have to
depend on the Chili coast as their only outlet to the sea.
And the millions of congested population of the coast
and the Yangtze valley need an entrance to the virgin
soil of the Mongolian Prairie and the Tienshan Valley.
The port will be the shortest doorway and the cheapest
passage to these regions.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/figure_1.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 1</span></div></div>

<p>The locality of our projected port is nearest to deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
water line, and far away from any large river which
might carry silt to fill up the approach of the harbor
like those of the Hoangho entrance and the Yangtze
estuary which cause great trouble to conservancy work.
So it has no great natural obstacle to be overcome.
Moreover, it is situated in an arid plain with few people
living on it, so it has no artificial hindrance to be
overcome. We can do whatever we please in the
process of construction.</p>

<div id="ip_17" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/figure_2.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 2</span></div></div>

<p>As regards the planning and estimation of the work
of the harbor construction and city building, I must
leave them to experts who have to make extensive
surveys and soundings before detailed plan and proper
estimation could be made. Whereas for rough reference
see Map I, and figures 1 and 2.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>  As soon as this first program reached the American Legation
in Peking, the former Minister, Dr. Paul S. Reinsch, immediately
sent an expert to survey the site which the writer indicated, and
found that it is really the best site on the Chili Coast for a world
harbor, excepting that the entrance of the port should be at
the west side instead of the east side as the writer proposed.
Detailed plans have been made as figures 1 and 2.</p></div>

<h3>PART II<br />

<span class="subhead">The Northwestern Railway System</span></h3>

<p>Our projected Railway will start at the Great Northern
Port and follow the Lwan Valley to the prairie city
of Dolon Nor, a distance of three hundred miles. This
railway should be built in double tracks at the commencement.
As our projected Port is a starting point
to the sea, so Dolon Nor is a gate to the vast prairie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
which our projected Railway System is going to tap.
It is from Dolon Nor our Northwestern Railway System
is going to radiate. First, a line N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;E. will run
parallel to the Khingan Range to Khailar, and thence to
Moho, the gold district on the right bank of the Amur
River. This line is about eight hundred miles in length.
Second, a line N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. to Kurelun, and thence to the
frontier to join the Siberian line near Chita. This
line has a distance of about six hundred miles. Third,
a trunk line northwest, west, and southwest, skirting
off the northern edge of the desert proper, to Urumochi
at the western end of China, a distance of about one
thousand six hundred miles all on level land. Fourth,
a line from Urumochi westward to Ili, a distance of
about four hundred miles. Fifth, a line from Urumochi
southeast across the Tienshan gap into the
Darim basin, then turning southwest running along the
fertile zone between the southern watershed of the
Tienshan and the northern edge of the Darim Desert,
to Kashgar, and thence turning southeast to another
fertile zone between the eastern watershed of the
Pamir, the northern watershed of the Kuenlum Mountain
and the southern edge of the Darim Desert, to the
city of Iden or Keria, a distance of about one thousand
two hundred miles all on level land. Sixth, a branch
from the Dolon Nor Urumochi Trunk Line, which
I shall call Junction A, to Urga and thence to the
frontier city Kiakata, a distance of about three
hundred and fifty miles. Seventh, a branch from Junction
B to Uliassutai and beyond N.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;W. up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
frontier, a distance of about six hundred miles. And
eighth, a branch from Junction C northwest to the
frontier, a distance of about four hundred and fifty
miles. See Map II.</p>

<div id="ip_18" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_i.jpg" width="600" height="427" alt="Map I" /><br /></div>

<p>Regarded from the principle of "following the line
of least resistance" our projected railways in this
program is the most ideal one. For most of the seven
thousand miles of lines under this project are on
perfectly level land. For instance, the Trunk Line
from Dolon Nor to Kashgar and beyond, about a
distance of three thousand miles right along is on the
most fertile plain and encounters no natural obstacles,
neither high mountains nor great rivers.</p>

<p>Regarded from the principle of "the most suitable
position," our projected railways will command the
most dominating position of world importance. It will
form a part of the trunk line of the Eurasian system
which will connect the two populous centers, Europe
and China, together. It will be the shortest line from
the Pacific Coast to Europe. Its branch from Ili will
connect with the future Indo-European line, and
through Bagdad, Damascus and Cairo, will link up
also with the future African system. Then there will
be a through route from our projected port to Capetown.
There is no existing railway commanding such
a world important position as this.</p>

<div id="ip_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_ii.jpg" width="600" height="425" alt="Map II" /><br /></div>

<p>Regarded from the principle of the "most urgent
need of the Nation," this railway system becomes the
first in importance, for the territories traversed by it
are larger than the eighteen provinces of China Proper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Owing to the lack of means of transportation and communication
at present these rich territories are left
undeveloped and millions of laborers in the congested
provinces along the Coast and in the Yangtze Valley
are without work. What a great waste of natural and
human energies. If there is a railway connecting these
vast territories, the waste labor of the congested provinces
can go and develop these rich soils for the good
not only of China but also of the whole commercial
world. So a system of railways to the northwestern
part of the country is the most urgent need both
politically and economically for China to-day.</p>

<p>I have intentionally left out the first principle&mdash;"the
most remunerative field must be selected"&mdash;not because
I want to neglect it but because I mean to call more
attention to it and treat it more fully. It is commonly
known to financiers and railway men that a railway in
a densely populated country from end to end is the best
paying proposition, and a railway in a thinly settled
country from end to end is the least paying one. And
a railway in an almost unpopulated country like our
projected lines will take a long time to make it a paying
business. That is why the United States Government
had to grant large tracts of public lands to railway
corporations to induce them to build the Transcontinental
lines to the Pacific Coast, half a century ago.
Whenever I talked with foreign railway men and
financiers about the construction of railways to Mongolia
and Sinkiang, they generally got very shy of the
proposition. Undoubtedly they thought that it is for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
political and military reasons only that such a line
as the Siberian Railway was built, which traversed
through a thinly populated land. But they could not
grasp the fact which might be entirely new to them,
that a railway between a densely populated country
and a sparsely settled country will pay far better than
one that runs from end to end in a densely populated
land. The reason is that in economic conditions the
two ends of a well populated country are not so different
as that between a thickly populated country and
a newly opened country. At the two ends of a well
populated country, in many respects, the local people
are self-supplying, excepting a few special articles
which they depend upon the other end of the road to
supply. So the demand and supply between the two
places are not very great, thus the trade between the
two ends of the railway could not be very lucrative.
While the difference of the economic condition between
a well populated country and an unpopulated country
is very great. The workers of the new land have to
depend upon the supplies of the thickly populated
country almost in everything excepting foodstuffs and
raw materials which they have in abundance and for
disposal of which they have to depend upon the demand
of the well populated district. Thus the trade between
the two ends of the line will be extraordinarily great.
Furthermore, a railway in a thickly populated place
will not affect much the masses which consist of the
majority of the population. It is only the few well-to-do
and the merchants and tradesmen that make use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
it. While with a railway between a thickly populated
country and a sparsely settled or unsettled country, as
soon as it is opened to traffic for each mile, the masses
of the congested country will use it and rush into the
new land in a wholesale manner. Thus the railway will
be employed to its utmost capacity in passenger traffic
from the beginning. The comparison between the
Peking-Hankow Railway and the Peking-Mukden
Railway in China is a convincing proof.</p>

<p>The Peking-Hankow Railway is a line of over eight
hundred miles running from the capital of the country
to the commercial center in the heart of China right
along in an extraordinarily densely settled country
from end to end. While the Peking-Mukden line is
barely six hundred miles in length running from a
thickly populated country to thinly populated Manchuria.
The former is a well paying line but the latter
pays far better. The net profit of the shorter Peking-Mukden
Line is sometimes three to four millions more
yearly than that of the longer Peking-Hankow line.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is logically clear that a railway in a
thickly populated country is much better than one that
is in a thinly populated country in remuneration. But
a railway between a very thickly populated and a very
thinly populated or unpopulated country is the best
paying proposition. This is a law in Railway Economics
which hitherto had not been discovered by railway
men and financiers.</p>

<p>According to this new railway economic law, our
projected railway will be the best remunerative project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
of its kind. For at the one end, we have our
projected port which acts as a connecting link with
the thickly populated coast of China and the Yangtze
Valley and also the two existing lines, the Kingham
and the Tsinpu, as feeders to the projected port and the
Dolon Nor line. And at the other end, we have a vast
and rich territory, larger than China Proper, to be
developed. There is no such vast fertile field so near
to a center of a population of four hundred millions
to be found in any other part of the world.</p>

<h3>PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">The Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang</span></h3>

<p>The Colonization of Mongolia and Sinkiang is a
complement of the Railway scheme. Each is dependent
upon the other for its prosperity. The colonization
scheme, besides benefitting the railway, is in itself
a greatly profitable undertaking. The results of the
United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina are
ample proofs of this. In the case of our project, it is
simply a matter of applying waste Chinese labor and
foreign machinery to a fertile land for production for
which its remuneration is sure. The present Colonization
of Manchuria, notwithstanding its topsy turvy
way which caused great waste of land and human
energy, has been wonderfully prosperous. If we would
adopt scientific methods in our colonization project we
could certainly obtain better results than all the others.
Therefore, I propose that the whole movement be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
directed in a systematic way by state organization with
the help of foreign experts and war organizers, for the
good of the colonists particularly and the nation
generally.</p>

<p>The land should be bought up by the state in order
to prevent the speculators from creating the dog-in-the-manger
system, to the detriment of the public. The
land should be prepared and divided into farmsteads,
then leased to colonists on perpetual term. The initial
capital, seeds, implements and houses should be furnished
by the state at cost price on cash or on the
instalment plan. For these services, big organizations
should be formed and war work measures should be
adopted in order to transport, to feed, to clothe and to
house every colonist on credit in his first year.</p>

<p>As soon as a sufficient number of colonists is settled
in a district, franchise should be given for self-government
and the colonists should be trained to manage
their own local affairs with perfect democratic spirit.</p>

<p>If within ten years we can transport, let us say, ten
millions of the people, from the congested provinces
of China, to the Northwestern territory to develop its
natural resources, the benefit to the commercial world
at large will be enormous. No matter how big a capital
that shall have been invested in the project it could be
repaid within a very short time. So in regard to its
bearing to "the principle of remuneration" there is no
question about it.</p>

<p>Regarded from "the principle of the need of the
Nation" colonization is the most urgent need of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
first magnitude. At present China has more than a
million soldiers to be disbanded. Besides, the dense
population will need elbow room to move in. This
Colonization project is the best thing for both purposes.
The soldiers have to be disbanded at great expense and
hundreds of millions of dollars may be needed for disbandment
alone, in paying them off with a few months'
pay. If nothing more could be done for these soldiers'
welfare, they will either be left to starve or to rob for
a living. Then the consequences will be unimaginable.
This calamity must be prevented and prevented effectively.
The best way for this is the colonization
scheme. I hope that the friendly foreign financiers, who
have the welfare of China at heart, when requested to
float a reorganization loan for the Chinese Government
in the future, will persist on the point&mdash;that the money
furnished must first be used to carry out the colonization
scheme for the disbanded soldiers. Otherwise,
their money will only work disasters to China.</p>

<p>For the million or more of the soldiers to be disbanded,
the district between our projected port and
Dolon Nor is quite enough to accommodate them. This
district is quite rich in mineral resources and is very
sparsely settled. If a railway is to start at once from
the projected port to Dolon Nor these soldiers could be
utilized as a pioneer party for the work of the port,
of the railway, of the developing of the adjacent land
beyond the Great Wall, and of preparing Dolon Nor
as a jumping ground for further colonization development
of the great northern plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<h3>PART IV<br />

<span class="subhead">The Construction of Canals to connect the Inland
Waterway Systems of North and Central
China with the Great Northern Port</span></h3>

<p>This scheme will include the regulation of the
Hoangho and its branches, the Weiho in Shensi, and
the Fenho in Shansi and connecting canals. The
Hoangho should be deepened at its mouth in order to
give a good drawing to clear its bed of silt and carry
the same to the sea. For this purpose, jetties should
be built far out to the deep sea, as those at the mouths
of the Mississippi in America. Its embankments
should be parallel in order to make the width of the
channel equal right along, so as to give equal velocity
to the current which will prevent the deposit of silt at
the bottom. By dams and locks, it could be made
navigable right up to Lanchow, in the province of
Kansu, and at the same time water power could be
developed. The Weiho and the Fenho can also be
treated in the same manner so as to make them navigable
to a great extent in the provinces of Shensi and
Shansi. Thus the provinces of Kansu, Shensi, and
Shansi can be connected by waterway with our projected
port on the Gulf of Pechili, so that cheap carriage
can be provided for the rich mineral and other
products from these three hitherto secluded provinces.</p>

<p>The expenses of regulating the Hoangho may be
very great. As a paying project, it may not be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
attractive but as a flood preventive measure, it is the
most important task to the whole nation. This river
has been known as "China's Sorrow" for thousands of
years. By its occasional overflow and bursting of its
embankments, millions of lives and billions of money
have been destroyed. It is a constant source of anxiety
in the minds of all China's statesmen from time immemorial.
A permanent safeguard must be effected,
once for all, despite the expenses that will be incurred.
The whole nation must bear the burden of its expenses.
To deepen its mouth, to regulate its embankments and
to build extra dykes are only half of the work to
prevent flood. The entire reforestation of its watershed
to prevent the washing off of loess is another half
of the work in the prevention of flood.</p>

<p>The Grand Canal, the former Great Waterway of
China between the North and the South for centuries,
and now being reconstructed in certain sections, should
be wholly reconstructed from end to end, in order to
restore the inland waterway traffic from the Yangtze
Valley to the North. The reconstruction of this canal
will be a great remunerative concern for it runs right
along from Tientsin to Hangchow in an extremely
rich and populous country.</p>

<p>Another new canal should be constructed from our
projected port to Tientsin to link up all the inland
waterway systems to the new port. This new canal
should be built extra wide and deep, let us say, similar
to the present size of the Peiho, for the use of the
coasting and shallow-draft vessels which the Peiho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
now accommodates for other than the winter seasons.
The banks of this canal should be prepared for factory
sites so as to enable it to pay not only by its traffic but
also from the land on both sides of its banks.</p>

<p>As for planning and estimating these river and canal
works, the assistance of technical experts must be
solicited.</p>

<h3>PART V<br />

<span class="subhead">The Development of the Iron and Coal Fields in
Chili and Shansi, and the Construction
of Iron and Steel Works</span></h3>

<p>Since we have in hand in this program the work of
the construction of the Great Northern Port, the work
of the building of a system of railways from the Great
Northern Port to the North Western Extremity of
China, the work of the Colonization of Mongolia and
Sinkiang, and the work of the construction of canals
and improvement of rivers to connect with the Great
Northern Port, the demand for materials will be very
great. As the iron and coal resources of every industrial
country are decreasing rapidly every year, and as
all of them are contemplating the conservation of their
natural resources for the use of future generations,
if all the materials for the great development of China
were to be drawn from them, the draining of the
natural resources of those countries will be detrimental
for their future generations. Besides, the
present need of the post-bellum reconstruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Europe has already absorbed all the iron and coal that
the industrial world could supply. Therefore, new
resources must be opened up to meet the extraordinary
demand of the development of China.</p>

<p>The unlimited iron and coal fields of Shansi and
Chili should be developed on a large scale. Let us say
a capital of from five hundred to a thousand million
dollars Mex. should be invested in this project. For
as soon as the general development of China is started
we would have created a vast market for iron and steel
which the present industrial world will be unable to
supply. Think of our railway construction, city building,
harbor works, and various kinds of machineries
and implements that will be needed! In fact, the
development of China means the creation of a new
need of various kinds of goods, for which, we must
undertake to create the supply also, by utilizing the raw
materials near by. Thus a great iron and steel works
is an urgent necessity as well as a greatly profitable
project.</p>

<p>In this <span class="smcap">First Program</span>, we have followed the four
principles set forth at the outset pretty closely. As
needs create new needs and profits promote more
profits, so our first program will be the forerunner of
the other great developments, which we will deal with
shortly.</p>

<h3>PART I<br />

<span class="subhead">The Great Eastern Port</span></h3>

<p>Although Shanghai is already the largest port in all
China, as it stands it will not meet the future needs and
demands of a world harbor. Therefore there is a movement
at present among the foreign merchants in China
to construct a world port in Shanghai. Several plans
have been proposed such as to improve the existing
arrangement, to build a wet dock by closing the Whangpoo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
to construct a closed harbor on the right bank of
the Yangtze outside of Whangpoo, and to excavate a
new basin just east of Shanghai with a shipping canal
to Hangchow Bay. It is estimated that a cost of over
one hundred million dollars Mex. must be spent before
Shanghai can be made a first-class port.</p>

<p>According to the four principles I set forth in Program
I, Shanghai as a world port for Eastern China is
not in an ideal position. The best position for a port
of that kind is at a point just south of Chapu on the
Hangchow Bay. This locality is far superior to
Shanghai as an eastern port for China from the standpoint
of our four principles as set forth in our first
program. Henceforth, in our course of discussion,
we shall call this the "Projected Port" so as to distinguish
it from Shanghai, the existing port of Eastern
China.</p>

<h4>The Projected Port</h4>

<p>The "Projected Port" will be on the Bay which lies
between the Chapu and the Kanpu promontories, a
distance of about fifteen miles. A new sea wall should
be built from one promontory to the other and a gap
should be left at the Chapu end, a few hundred feet
from the hill as an entrance to the harbor. The sea
wall should be divided into five sections of three miles
each. For the present, one section of three miles in
length and one and a half miles in width should be
built and a harbor of three or more square miles so
formed would be sufficient. With the growth of commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
one section after another could be added to meet
the needs. The front sea wall should be built of stone
or concrete, while the transverse wall between the sea
wall and the land side should be built of sand and bush
mattress as a temporary structure to be removed in
case of the extension of the harbor. Once a harbor is
formed there need be no trouble regarding the future
conservancy work, for there is no silt-carrying water in
the vicinity by which the harbor and its approaches
may be silted up afterwards. The entrance of our
harbor is in the deepest part of the Hangchow Bay,
and from the entrance to the open sea there is an
average depth of six to seven fathoms at low water.
The largest ocean liner could therefore come into port
at any hour. Thus as a first-class seaport in Central
China our Projected Port is superior to Shanghai.
See Map III.</p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
  <img src="images/map_iii.jpg" width="425" height="600" alt="Map III" /><br /></div>

<p>From the viewpoint of the principle of the line of
least resistance, our Projected Port will be on new
land which will offer absolute freedom for city planning
and industrial development. All public utilities and
transportation plants can be constructed according to
the most up-to-date methods. This point alone is an
important factor for a future city like ours which in
time is bound to grow as large as New York City.
If one hundred years ago human foresight could have
foreseen the present size and population of New York,
much of the labor and money spent could have been
saved and blunders due to shortsightedness avoided in
meeting conditions of the ever growing population and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
commerce of that city. With this in view a great
Eastern Port in China should be started on new
ground to insure room for growth proportionate to
its needs.</p>

<div id="ip_33" class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
  <img src="images/map_iv.jpg" width="418" height="600" alt="Map IV" /><br /></div>

<p>Moreover, all the natural advantages which Shanghai
possesses as a central mart and Yangtze Port in
Eastern China are also possessed by our Projected
Port. Furthermore, our Projected Port in comparison
with Shanghai is of shorter distance, by rail communication,
to all the large cities south of the Yangtze.
And if the existing waterway between this part of the
country and Wuhu were improved then the water communication
with the upper Yangtze would also be
shorter from our Projected Port than from Shanghai.
And all the artificial advantages possessed by Shanghai
as a large city and a commercial center in this
part of China can be easily attained by our Projected
Port within a short time.</p>

<p>Comparing Shanghai with our Projected Port from
a remunerative point of view in our development
scheme, the former is much inferior in position to the
latter, for valuable lands have to be bought and costly
plants and existing arrangements have to be scrapped
the cost of which alone is enough to construct a fine
harbor on our projected site. Therefore, it is highly
advisable to construct another first-class port for
Eastern China like the one I here propose, leaving
Shanghai to be an inland mart and manufacturing center
as Manchester is in relation to Liverpool, Osaka
to Kobe, and Tokyo to Yokohama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Our Projected Port will be a highly remunerative
proposition for the cost of construction will be many
times cheaper than Shanghai and the work simpler.
The land between Chapu and Kanpu and farther on
will not cost more than fifty to one hundred dollars a
mow. The State should take up a few hundred square
miles of land in this neighborhood for the scheme of
our future city development. Let us say two hundred
square miles of land at the price of one hundred dollars
a mow be taken up. As six mows make an acre and
six hundred and forty acres a square mile, two hundred
square miles would cost 76,000,000 dollars Mex. An
enormous sum for a project indeed! But the land
could be fixed at the present price and the State could
buy only that part of land which will immediately be
taken up and used. The other part of the land would
remain as State land unpaid for and left to the original
owners' use without the right to sell. Thus the State
only takes up as much land as it could use in the development
scheme at a fixed price which remains permanent.
The payment then would be gradual. The
State could pay for the land from its unearned increment
afterwards. So that only the first allotment of
land has to be paid for from the capital fund; the rest
will be paid for by its own future value. After the first
section of the harbor is completed and the port developed,
the price of land then would be bound to rise
rapidly, and within ten years the land value within the
city limits would rise to various grades from a thousand
to a hundred thousand dollars per mow. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
land itself would be a source of profit. Besides there
would also be the profit from the scheme itself, i.e., the
harbor and the city. Because of its commanding position,
the harbor has every possibility of becoming a
city equal to New York. It would probably be the only
deep-water seaport for the Yangtze Valley and beyond,
an area peopled by two hundred million inhabitants,
twice the population of the whole United States. The
rate of growth of such a city would be in proportion
to the rate of progress of the working out of the development
scheme. If war work methods, that is,
gigantic planning and efficient organization, were applied
to the construction of the harbor and city, then
an Oriental New York City would spring up in a very
short time.</p>

<h4>Shanghai as the Great Eastern Port</h4>

<p>If only to provide a deep-water harbor for the future
commerce in this part of China is our object then
there is no question about the choice between Shanghai
and our Projected Port. From every point of view
Shanghai is doomed. However, in our scheme of development
of China, Shanghai has certain claims for
our consideration which may prove its salvation as an
important city. The curse of Shanghai as a world
port for future commerce is the silt of the Yangtze
which fills up all its approaches rapidly every year.
This silt, according to the estimation of Mr. Von
Heidenstam, Engineer-in-chief of the Whangpoo Conservancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Board, is a hundred million tons a year and is
sufficient to cover an area of forty square miles ten
feet deep. So before Shanghai can be considered ever
likely to become a world port this silt problem must
first be solved. Fortunately, in our program, we have
the regulation of the Yangtze Channels and Embankments,
which will coöperate in solving the problem of
Shanghai. Thus with this scheme in mind we might
just as well consider that the silt question of Shanghai
has been solved and let us go ahead, while leaving the
regulation of the Yangtze Estuary to the next part, to
deal with the improvement of the Shanghai Harbor.</p>

<p>There are many plans proposed by experts for improving
the Shanghai Harbor as stated before, and
some of them will necessitate the scrapping of all the
work which has been done by the Whangpoo Conservancy
Board for the last twelve years, at the cost
of eleven million taels. Here I wish to present a
layman's plan for the consideration of specialists and
the public.</p>

<p>My project for the construction of a world harbor
in Shanghai is to leave the existing arrangement intact
from the mouth of the Whangpoo to the junction of
Kao Chiao Creek above Gough Island. Thus all the
work hitherto done by the Whangpoo Conservancy
Board for the last twelve years will be saved. The
plan is to cut a new canal from the junction of Kao
Chiao Creek right into Pootung to prolong that part
of the channel which has been completed by the Conservancy
Work, and to enlarge the curve along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
right side of the Whangpoo River and join it again,
at the second turn above Lunghwa Railway Junction,
so as to make the river from that point to a point opposite
Yangtzepoo Point almost in a straight line and
thence a gentle curve to Woosung. This new canal would
encircle nearly thirty square miles of land which would
form the civic center and the New Bund of our future
Shanghai. Of course the present crooked Whangpoo
right in front of Shanghai would have to be filled up
to form boulevards and business lots. It goes without
saying that the reclaimed lots from the Whangpoo
would become State property and the land between this
and the new river and beyond should be taken up by
the State and put at the disposal of the International
Development Organization. Thus it may be possible
for Shanghai to compete with our Projected Port
economically in its construction and therefore to attract
foreign capital, to the improvement of Shanghai as a
future world port. See Map IV.</p>

<p>Below Yangtzepoo Point I propose to build a wet
dock. This dock should be laid between the left bank
of the present Whangpoo, from Yangtzepoo Point to
the turn above Gough Island and the left bank of the
new river. The space of the dock should be about six
square miles. A lock entrance is to be constructed at
the point above Gough Island. The wet dock should
be forty feet deep and the new river can also be made
the same depth by flushing with the water, not as proposed
by experts, from a lock canal between the
Yangtze and the Taihu, at Kiangyin, but from our improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
waterway between this part of the country and
Wuhu so that a much stronger current could be obtained.</p>

<p>As we see that the present Whangpoo has to be reclaimed
from the second turn above Lunghwa Railway
Junction to Yangtzepoo Point for city planning, then
the question of how to dispose of the Soochow Creek
must be answered. I propose that this stream should
be led alongside the right bank of the future defunct
river and straight on to the upper end of the wet dock,
thence joining the new canal. At the point of contact
of the Creek and the wet dock a lock entrance may
be provided in order to facilitate water traffic from
Soochow as well as the inland water system directly
with the wet dock.</p>

<p>As the first principle in our program was remuneration,
all our plans must strictly follow this principle.
To create Pootung Point, therefore, as a civic center
and to build a new Bund farther on along the left bank
of the new canal in order to increase the value of the
new land which would result from this scheme must
be kept in mind. Only by so doing would the construction
of Shanghai as a deep harbor be worth while. And
only by creating some new and valuable property in this
fore-doomed port could Shanghai be saved from
the competition of our Projected Port. After all, the
most important factor for the salvation of Shanghai
is the solution of the silt question of the Yangtze
Estuaries. Now let us see what effect and bearing the
regulating of the Yangtze Channel and Embankments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
have upon the question, and this we are going to deal
with in the next part.</p>

<h3>PART II<br />

<span class="subhead">The Regulating of the Yangtze River</span></h3>

<p>The regulating of the Yangtze River may be divided
as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul>
<li>a. From the deep-water line of the sea to Whangpoo Junction.</li>
<li>b. From Whangpoo Junction to Kiangyin.</li>
<li>c. From Kiangyin to Wuhu.</li>
<li>d. From Wuhu to Tungliu.</li>
<li>e. From Tungliu to Wusueh.</li>
<li>f. From Wusueh to Hankow.</li>
</ul></div>

<h4>a. Regulating of the Estuary from Deep-water Line Up to the Junction of Whangpoo</h4>

<p>It is a natural law that the obstruction to navigation
in all rivers is begun at their mouths, therefore the
improvement of any river for navigation must start
from the estuary. The Yangtze River is no exception
to this rule, therefore to regulate the Yangtze, we must
begin by dealing with its estuaries.</p>

<p>The Yangtze has three estuaries, namely: The North
Branch lying between the left bank and the Island of
Tsungming, the North Channel lying between the
Tsungming Island and the Tungsha Banks and the
South Channel lying between the Tungsha Banks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the right bank. Henceforth for the sake of convenience
I shall call them the North, Middle, and South
Channels.</p>

<p>The silting up of a river's mouth is due to the loss of
velocity in its current when the water gets into the
wide opening at its junction with the sea and causes the
silt to deposit there. The remedy is to maintain the
velocity of the current by narrowing the mouth of the
river so that it equals that of the upper part. In this
way the silt is suspended in the water moving on into
the deep sea. The narrowing process may be accomplished
by walls or training jetties. And thus the silt
may be carried by the water into the deepest part of the
open sea and before it settles down upon the bottom
a returning tide will carry it from the approach into the
shallow parts on both sides of the river's mouth. The
mouth of a river can be kept clear from deposit of silt
by the action and reaction of the ebb and flow tide.
The conservancy of an estuary of any river is accomplished
by utilizing these natural forces.</p>

<p>In order to regulate the estuary of the Yangtze we
have to study the three channels which form its mouth
and to find out which of these channels is to be selected
as the regulated entrance into the sea. In Mr. Von
Heidenstam's proposal for the improvement of the approach
of Shanghai Harbor, he recommends two alternatives,
viz., either to block up the North and Middle
Channels and to leave the South Channel only for the
mouth of the Yangtze, or to train the South Channel
only and leave the other two alone. For the present, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
thinks, perhaps for the sake of economy, the latter
scheme would be enough. But the training of the South
Channel alone as the approach to Shanghai would leave
it in a state of perpetual anxiety as has been apprehended
by Mr. Von Heidenstam and other experts, for
the main volume of the water of the Yangtze may be
diverted into either of the other two channels and leave
the Southern one to be silted up at any time. Therefore
to make the approach of Shanghai once for all
safe and permanent, it is necessary to block up two of
the three channels, leaving only one as an approach to
the port. This is also the only feasible way of regulating
the estuary of the Yangtze.</p>

<p>In our scheme of regulating the Yangtze Estuary I
should recommend using the North Channel only and
to block the other two. Because the North Channel
is the shortest way to the deep-sea line and by using it
as the only mouth of the Yangtze, we have on both
sides of it more shallow banks to be reclaimed by its
silt. Thus the expenditure would be less and the results
greater. But this would leave Shanghai in the
lurch. Therefore in a coöperative scheme like this I
would apply the theory of killing two birds with one
stone by using the Middle Channel, since it would suit
both of our purposes. The reason for this is because
the regulating of the Yangtze Estuary and the securing
of a Shanghai approach have different purposes, hence
we must consider them differently.</p>

<p>In my project of regulating the Yangtze Estuary I
have two aims, namely, to secure a deep channel to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
open sea and to save as much silt as possible for the
purpose of reclamation of land. The Middle Channel
provides three ready receptacles for the deposit of the
silt for the formation of new land: the Haimen, the
Tsungming, and the Tungsha Banks. Besides these
banks there are many hundreds of square miles of shallow
bottom which in the course of ten or twenty years
will also form land. As remuneration is our first principle
we must consider it in every step of our progress.
The reclamation of about a thousand square miles of
land even in forty not to say twenty years would be
ample profit. At the lowest estimate the reclaimed land
would be worth twenty dollars per mow. If after ten
years five hundred square miles would be ready for cultivation
purposes then we would gain a profit of
38,000,000 dollars. Whereas to make an approach by
the South Channel the receptacle ground will be on
one side only, that is, the Tungsha Banks, while on the
right of the approach is the deep Hangchow Bay which
would take hundreds of years to fill up, and in the
meanwhile half of the silt would be wasted. To Shanghai
as a seaport the silt is a curse but to the shallow
banks the silt would be a blessing.</p>

<p>Since it is a profitable undertaking to reclaim the
above mentioned banks and the neighboring shallows,
we can quite well afford to build a double stone wall
from the shore end of the Yangtze right out into the
deep sea far beyond Shaweishan Island which is a
distance of about forty miles. A stone wall from one
fathom to five fathoms in height at low-water level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
would likely not exceed an average cost of two hundred
thousand dollars a mile as cheap stone can easily be
obtained from the granite islands nearby, in the Chusan
Archipelago. A wall of forty miles on each side that
is eighty miles in all will cost sixteen million dollars
or thereabouts. And considering that 200 or 300 square
miles of Haimen, Tsungming, and the Tungsha banks
could be converted into arable land within a short time,
the expense of building the wall is well justified. Furthermore,
the construction of this wall means that there
will be a safe and permanent approach for a world
port in Shanghai as well as a deep outlet for the Yangtze.
See Map V.</p>

<p>The regulating wall on the right side should be built
from the junction of the Whangpoo by prolongation
of its right jetty describing a gentle curve into the
depths of the South Channel and turning toward the
opposite side and cutting through the Blockhouse
Island into the Middle Channel, then running eastward
right into the five-fathom line southeast of
Shaweishan Island. The left wall would be a continuation
from that of Tsungming at Tsungpaosha Island
parallel with the right wall by a distance of about two
miles. This wall should curve to a point at or near
Drinkwater Point at Tsungming Island, then project
into the five-fathom line at the open sea passing by
just at the south side of the Shaweishan Island. A
glance at the map here attached would be sufficient to
show how the future outlet of the Yangtze as well as
the future approach of Shanghai should be. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
regulating submerged walls on both sides would be as
high as low-water level so as to give a free passage of
the water over the top at flood tide. This will serve
the purpose of carrying back the silt from the sea when
the tide comes in, thus to reclaim the shallow spaces
inclosed behind the walls on both sides of the river
more quickly than otherwise. The new channel formed
by these two parallel walls would likely be deeper than
the present South Channel outside the Whangpoo,
which is forty to fifty feet deep because the velocity of
the current will be greater than the present one, due to
the concentration of three channels into one. Furthermore,
the depth would be more uniform and stable than
at present. Although the regulating walls end at the
five-fathom line, the momentum of the current would
continue beyond that point, and so would cut into the
deep water outside. This would serve the double purpose
of draining the Yangtze Estuary as well as keeping
open the approach to Shanghai.</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_v.jpg" width="600" height="433" alt="Map V" /><br /></div>

<h4>b. From Whangpoo Junction to Kiangyin</h4>

<p>This part of the channel of the Yangtze River is most
irregular and changeable. The widest part is over ten
miles while the Kiangyin Narrow is only but three-quarters
of a mile. The depth of the channel at the
open part is from five to ten fathoms while that of
Kiangyin Narrow is twenty fathoms. Judging by the
depth of the water at this point a width of one and a
half miles must be provided for the channel in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
slow down the current and to give a uniform velocity
right along the river. So the two-mile wide channel
at Whangpoo Junction has to be tabulated into one
mile and a half at Kiangyin. See Map VI.</p>

<div id="ip_45" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_vi.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="Map VI" /><br /></div>

<p>The north or left embankment commencing at
Tsungpao Sha continues with the sea wall and makes a
convex curve up to Tsungming Island at a point about
six miles northwest from Tsungming city. Then it
follows along the shore of Tsungming right up to Mason
Point and transversing across the north channel
parallel to the north shore at a distance of three or four
miles right up to Kinshan Point, thence it cuts across
the deep channel which was formed in recent years and
curves southwestward to join the shore northeast of
Tsingkiang and follows the shore line for a distance of
about seven or eight miles, then cuts into the land side
to give this part of the river a width of one and a half
miles from the fort at the Kiangyin side. This embankment
from Tsungpao Sha to Tsingkiang Point
opposite Kiangyin fort is about one hundred miles in
length.</p>

<p>South of Tsungming Island a part of this embankment
and a part of the wall that projects into the sea
together inclose a shallow space of about 160 square
miles good for reclamation purposes. The other part
of the embankment, which runs from Mason Point at
the head of Tsungming Island to Tsingkiang shore,
incloses another space of about 130 square miles.</p>

<p>The right embankment starts at the end of the left
jetty of Whangpoo Junction and, skirting along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Paoshan shore and passing the Blonde Shoal into the
deep, crosses the Confucius Channel on into Actaon
Shoal and follows the right side of Harvey Channel on
to Plover Point. Then it turns northwest across the
deep channel into Langshan Flats, thence recrosses the
deep channel at Langshan crossing into Johnson Flats,
then joins the Pitman King Island, and thence skirts
along the shore right into the foot of the hills at Kiangyin
forts. This embankment incloses two shallow
spaces: one above and the other below Plover Point,
together about 160 square miles. Alongside of both
of these embankments there are shallow spaces amounting
to about 450 square miles, a great part of which
having already formed land and a part already appearing
in low water. When these spaces are cut off from
the moving current the process of reclamation would
be made to work more rapidly so it is not extravagant
to hope that within the course of twenty years the
whole of these 450 square miles would be completely
reclaimed and ready for cultivation. The profits from
the new lands thus reclaimed would amount to about
$29,760,000 if only taken at $20 per mow. The profits
from the new lands would be netted from the beginning
of the work and would increase every year up to the
completion of the reclamation process.</p>

<p>With a profit of $30,000,000 in the course of twenty
years before us, it is a worth-while proposition to take
up. Now let us see what amount of capital should be
invested before the whole project of our reclamation
work could be completed. In order to reclaim this 450<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
square miles of land two hundred miles of embankments
have to be built. Part of these projected embankments
will be along the shore line, a greater part
will be in midstream, and a small part in deep channel.
Those along the shore line need not be bothered with
except that the concave surface must be protected with
stone or concrete work. Those in midstream should
be filled up with stone ten feet or less below low-water
level just enough to give a resistance to the undercurrent
in order to prevent it from running sideward.
Thus the main current would follow the line of least
resistance and cut the channel, as directed by the rudimental
embankment, by its own force. This rudimental
embankment would cost less than the sea wall which
I estimated at $200,000 per mile. Except at one
point, that is, the junction of the North Channel
at Mason Point, which has to be blocked up entirely,
the cost for which, as has been estimated by experts,
would amount to over a million dollars for a distance
of two or three miles. Thus the profits accruing from
the reclaimed lands would be quite sufficient to pay for
the embankments. So far we see that the regulating
of the Yangtze from the sea to Kiangyin is a self-paying
proposition from the reclamation of land alone,
aside from the improvement of the navigation of the
Yangtze River.</p>

<h4>c. From Kiangyin to Wuhu</h4>

<p>This part of the river is quite different in nature
from that below Kiangyin. Its channel is more stable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
and only in a few places sharp curves occur and the
water has cut into the concave sides of the land, thus
occasionally making new channels along the sides of
the two shores. This section of the river is about 180
miles in length. See Map VII.</p>

<p>The regulating works here would be more complicated
than those below Kiangyin. For besides the
dilated parts which have to be reclaimed in the same
manner as those of the lower part of the river, the
sharp curves have to be straightened and side channels
have to be blocked, and midstream islands have to be
removed, and narrows have to be widened to give uniform
width to the river. However, most of the existing
embankments in this part could be left as they are
except some of the concave surfaces of the shores
have to be protected by either stone or concrete work.
The regulating works of the channel and the embankments
can be done by artificial means as well as by
natural processes so as to economize as much as possible.
The cost of the whole works of this part of the
river cannot be accurately estimated until a detail survey
is made; but in a rough guess $400,000 per mile
may not be very far from the mark. Thus 180 miles
will cost $72,000,000 exclusive of the expenses for the
widening of the point between Nanking and Pukow,
in which case valuable properties will have to be removed.</p>

<div id="ip_48" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_vii.jpg" width="600" height="409" alt="Map VII" /><br /></div>

<p>The Kwachow cut is to straighten the three sharp
curves in front of and above Chinkiang by converting
them into one. Two and a half miles of the land in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the northern shore opposite Chinkiang will have to be
cut into in order to form a new channel of a mile or
more in width. The part of the river in front of, and
above and below Chinkiang has to be reclaimed. The
new land thus reclaimed would form the water front
of Chinkiang city, the value of which may be sufficient
to defray the cost of the work and compensate for the
land taken away on the northern shore, to form the
new channel. So the works of this part will be at
least a self-paying proposition.</p>

<div id="ip_49" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_viii.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="Map VIII" /><br /></div>

<p>The narrow between Pukow and Hsiakwan from
pier to pier is barely six cables wide. The depth of
the water in this narrow from the shallowest to the
deepest is six to twenty-two fathoms. The land of
the Hsiakwan side had occasionally sunk away on account
of the too rapid current and the depth of the
water. This indicates that this part is too narrow for
the volume of the Yangtze water to pass. Therefore
a wider passage must be provided for. In order to do
so, the whole town of Hsiakwan must be sacrificed as
the river must be widened right up to the foot of the
Lion Hill, so as to provide a passage of a mile wide at
this point. What the cost for the compensation of this
valuable property of Hsiakwan will be will have to be
submitted to the experts for a careful investigation before
it can be determined. This will be the most costly
part of the whole project for the regulating of the
Yangtze. But undoubtedly some equally valuable
property can be created along the riverside near by in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
place of Hsiakwan, so that a balance may be realized
by the work itself.</p>

<p>The channel below the Nanking Pukow Narrow will
follow the short passage alongside of the foot of the
Mofushan to Wulungshan. The loop around the
island north of Nanking will have to be blocked up in
order to straighten the course of the river.</p>

<p>The section of the river from Nanking to Wuhu is
almost in a straight line with three dilatations along its
course one just above Nanking the other two just
above and below the East and West pillars. To
regulate the first dilatation the channel above
Me-tse-chow should be blocked up and the island
outside of it should be partly cut to widen the
proper channel. To regulate the other two dilatations
the river should be made to curve toward Taiping Fu
to follow the deep channel on the right bank. The
left channel should be blocked up. The islands along
this curve should be partly or wholly removed. To
regulate the dilatation above the Pillars, the Friends
Channel should be blocked up and Friends Island be
partly cut away. And the left bank below Wuhu
should also be cut to give the channel a uniform width.</p>

<h4>d. From Wuhu to Tungliu</h4>

<p>This part of the river is about 130 miles in length.
Along its course there are six dilatations, the most
prominent of which is the one that lies immediately
below Tungling, which extends over ten miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
side to side. In each of these dilatations there are
usually two or three channels with newly formed islands
between them. The deep passage often changes from
one side to the other, and it is not uncommon that all
of the channels are filled up at the same time, thus
stopping navigation altogether for a considerable
period. See Map VIII.</p>

<p>In regulating the part of the river from ten miles
above Wuhu to ten miles below Tatung, I propose to
cut a new channel through the midstream islands
formed by the three dilatations and the sharp corners
of the shore, in order to straighten as well as to shorten
the river, as marked by the dotted lines in the map
attached here. The cost of the cut could not be estimated
until a detail survey is made. But as soon as the
embankments are laid out the natural force of the
river's own current will do a great part of the dredging
work, so that the expenses of the cutting for the
new channel will be much less than usual. Above
Tatung there are two sharp turns of the left shore
to be cut. One is on the left shore at the point where
the beacon now stands about twelve miles from Tatung.
In this place a few miles of the left shore will have to
be cut away. The other cut is just below the city of
Anking hence to Kianglung beacon, a distance of about
six miles. By this cut we do away with the sharp turns
of the river at Chuan Kiang Kau. These cuttings
would cost much more than the piling of stone at the
lower reach of the river. It is quite certain that the
reclamation of the side channels of this part will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
cover the cost of the cuttings. Therefore this part
of the regulating work will not be self-paying, but the
navigation of the Yangtze, the protection it gives to
both sides of the land, and the prevention of floods in
the future will amply compensate for such work.</p>

<h4>e. From Tungliu to Wusueh</h4>

<p>This part of the river is about eighty miles in length.
The land along the right bank is generally hilly while
that along the left is low. Along its course there are
four dilatations. In three of these dilatations the current
has cut into the left or northern bank of the river
and then turns back into its main course again almost
at right angles. At such points the bank is very unstable.
Between the channels of these dilatations
islands are being formed. See Map IX.</p>

<p>The regulating works of this part are much easier to
construct than those of the lower part. The three
diverting semicircular channels have to be blocked up
at the upper ends, and the lower openings left open for
silt to go into at flood seasons in order to reclaim them
by the natural process. The other dilatations should
be narrowed in from both sides by jetties. A few
places will have to be cut, the most important being
the Pigeon Island and the turn above Siau Ku Shan.
Some of the midstream islands will have to be removed,
and a few wide places filled up in order to make the
channel uniform, so as to give a regular minimum
depth of six fathoms right along the whole course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<h4>f. From Wusueh to Hankow</h4>

<p>This part of the river is about one hundred miles
long. Above Wusueh we enter into the hilly country
on both sides. The river here is generally about half
a mile wide, with a depth of from five to twelve fathoms
or sometimes more in certain places. See Map X.</p>

<p>To regulate this part of the river a few wide spaces
have to be reclaimed to give a uniform channel, and
the side channels at three or four places closed up.
Then we can make a channel with a uniform depth of
from six to eight fathoms at all seasons. At Collison
Island section of the river the Ayres Channel has to
be closed up, leaving the winter channel alone so as to
give a gentle curve above and below this island. At
Willes Island and Gravenor Island point the Round
Channel and the channel between these two islands
must be blocked up. The river must be made to cut
through Willes Island to make a shorter curve. At
Bouncer Island the South channel must be blocked up
and above this the Low Point turn must be cut away
to form a gentler curve. From this point to Hankow
the river should be made narrower first by reclaiming
the right side as far as the meeting of the southwest
curve with the right bank then the reclamation should
start at the opposite side of the left bank and right up
along the front of Hankow Settlement until the Han
River Mouth is reached. Thus a depth of six to eight
fathoms can be secured right up to the Bund of Hankow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
To sum up, the whole length of the regulating course
of the river from the deep sea to Hankow is about
630 miles. The embankments will be twice this length;
that is, 1,260 miles. I have estimated that the sea wall
at the mouth of the river could be built at $200,000
a mile, thus for both sides $400,000 a mile will
be sufficient for the 140 miles from the deep sea to
Kiangyin. For, in this part we have only the two embankments
to deal with, which merely requires the
tumbling of stones into the water until the pile is strong
enough to hold the current to a directed course. As
soon as these stone ridges on both sides of the river
are formed, nature will do the rest to make the channel
deep. The work for this part, therefore, is simple.</p>

<div id="ip_54" class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
  <img src="images/map_ix.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="Map IX" /><br /></div>

<p>But the work for certain sections of the upper part
of the river is more complicated as about fifty or sixty
miles of solid land of from ten to twenty feet above
water level and thirty to forty feet below have to be
cut in order to straighten the river's course. Of this
cutting and removing work, how much will have to be
done artificially and how much can be done by nature,
I leave to the experts to estimate. Excepting this, the
other parts of this work, I think, cannot cost much
more than $400,000 a mile. So that the whole
work from the sea to Hankow, a distance of 630 miles
will cost about $252,000,000, or let us say, including
the unknown part, $300,000,000 for the completion
of the entire project for the regulating of the
Yangtze River. By this regulating of the Yangtze
River, we secure an approach of 600 miles inland for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
ocean-going vessels into the very center of a continent
of two hundred millions of people of which half or
one hundred million is located immediately along 600
miles of the great water highway. As regards remuneration
for the work, this project will be more profitable
than either the Suez or Panama Canal.</p>

<div id="ip_55" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_x.jpg" width="600" height="412" alt="Map X" /><br /></div>

<p>Although we could not find means whereby the
works above Kiangyin may be made self-paying as
those of the sections below by the reclamation of land,
profit from city building along the course of the
river can be realized after the regulating work is
completed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must say that the figures given concerning
the harbor works and the Yangtze regulation
are merely rough estimates which must be in the nature
of the case. As regards the costs of building the rudimental
dikes at the estuary of the Yangtze as well as
along the dilating parts of the river, the estimation may
seem too low. But the data on which I base my estimate
are as follows: First, my own observation of
the private enterprise of reclamation by building dikes
at the Canton delta around my native village; second,
the cheap stone that can be obtained at the Chusan
Archipelago; third, the estimation of Mr. Tyler, Coast
Inspector of the Maritime Customs for the blocking
up of the North Channel at the upper end of Tsungming
Island, where the narrowest part is about three
miles. He says that a million taels or more is necessary
for the work. Or, let us say, in round figures, five
hundred thousand dollars (Mex.) a mile. This is two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and a half times my estimate. Now, let us compare
the difference. The three-mile channel at the upper
end of Tsungming has an average depth of twenty
feet of water, while in my project the sea wall or dikes
will be built in water having an average of less than
two thirds of this depth. Moreover, the work of
blocking up the North Channel entirely at a right angle
is many times more costly than that of building a rudimental
dike of the same length in a parallel line with
the current. Since five hundred thousand dollars are
enough to block up cross-wise a mile of river twenty
feet deep, two fifths of that sum should be quite sufficient
to finance the work that I have projected. While
writing this, I came across an article in the <i>Chicago
Railway Review</i>, May 17, 1919, dealing with the same
subject, which states that steel skeleton is a better and
cheaper substitute for stone or other materials for
building dikes and jetties in a muddy river like ours.
Thus, by this new method, we may be able to construct
embankments, with cheaper material than I have
hitherto known. So, although the estimate which I
have made may be somewhat low, yet it is not so far
from correct as it seems at first sight.</p>

<h3>PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">The Construction of River Ports</span></h3>

<p>The construction of river ports along the Yangtze
between Hankow and the sea will be one of the most
remunerative propositions in our development scheme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
For this part of the Yangtze Valley is richest in agricultural
and mineral products in China and is very
densely populated. With the cheap water transportation
provided by the completion of the regulating work both
sides of this water highway will surely become industrial
beehives. And with cheap labor near by, it will
not be a surprise if in the near future both banks will
become two continuous cities, as it were, right along
the whole extent of the river from Hankow to the sea.
In the meantime a few suitable spots should be chosen
for profitable city development. For this purpose I
will start from the lower part of the river as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. Chinkiang and North Side.</li>
<li>b. Nanking and Pukow.</li>
<li>c. Wuhu.</li>
<li>d. Anking and South Side.</li>
<li>e. Poyang Port.</li>
<li>f. Wuhan.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. Chinkiang and North Side</h4>

<p>Chinkiang is situated at the junction of the Grand
Canal and the Yangtze. It was an important center
of inland water traffic between the north and the south
before the steam age. But it will resume its former
grandeur and become more important when the old
inland waterway is improved, and new ones are constructed.
For it is the gateway between the Hoangho
and Yangtze valleys. Besides, by the southern portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
of the Grand Canal, Chinkiang is connected with the
Tsientang valley&mdash;the richest part of China. Thus,
this city is bound to grow into a great commercial
center in the near future.</p>

<p>In our regulation work of the Yangtze, we shall
add a piece of new land, over six square miles, in front
of Chinkiang. This land on the south side of the
river will be utilized for city-planning for our new
Chinkiang. On the north side, land should also be
taken up by the state to build another city. The north
side will be bound to outgrow that of the south for
the whole of Hoangho Valley could only emerge into
the Yangtze by waterway through this point. Docks
should be built between here and Yangchow for accommodation
of inland vessels, and modern facilities
should be provided for transhipment between inland
vessels and ocean-going steamers. This port should be
made as a distributing center as well as a collecting
center for the salt of the eastern coast. This, with the
help of modern methods, will reduce transportation
expenses. Stone or concrete bunds or quays should be
built on both sides of the river and tidal jetties should
be provided for train ferries. In time, when commerce
grows, tunnels or bridges may be added to facilitate
traffic of the two sides. The streets should be wide
so as to meet modern demands. The water front and
its neighborhood should be planned for industrial
and commercial uses and the land beyond should be
planned for residential purpose. Every modern public
utility should be provided. In regard to the details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of planning the city, I must leave them to the expert.</p>

<h4>b. Nanking and Pukow</h4>

<p>Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking,
and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high
mountains, deep water and a vast level plain&mdash;a rare
site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies
at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the
lower Yangtze. At present, although ruined and
desolate, it still has a population of over a quarter of a
million. Once it was the home of many industries
especially silk and now the finest satin and velvet are
still produced here. Nanking has yet a greater future
before her when the resources of the lower Yangtze
Valley are properly developed.</p>

<p>In the regulation of the Yangtze I propose to cut
away the town of Hsiakwan, so that the wharf of
Nanking could be removed into the deep channel between
Metsechow and the outskirt of Nanking. This
channel should be blocked up, thereby a wet dock could
be formed to accommodate all ocean-going vessels.
This point is much nearer the inhabited parts of the
city than Hsiakwan. And the land between this projected
wet dock and the city could form a new commercial
and industrial quarter which would be many
times larger than Hsiakwan. Metsechow in time, when
commerce grows, may also be developed into city lots
and business quarters. For the future development of
Nanking the land within and without the city should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
be taken up at the present price under the same principle
which I have proposed for the Projected Port
at Chapu.</p>

<p>Pukow, opposite Nanking, on the other side of the
river, will be the great terminus of all the railways of
the great northern plain to the Yangtze. It will be the
nearest river port for the rich coal and iron fields of
Shansi and Honan, giving access to the lower Yangtze
district and hence to the sea. As the great transcontinental
trunk line to the sea whether terminating at
Shanghai or at our Projected Port, would pass through
this point, the construction of a tunnel under the
Yangtze to connect Nanking and Pukow by rail at
the same time when the cities are being constructed,
will not be at all premature. This will
at once make possible a through train journey from
Shanghai to Peking.</p>

<p>Concrete or stone embankment should be built along
the shore above and below the present Pukow point
many miles in each direction. Modern streets should
be laid out on the land within the embankment so as
to be ready for various building purposes. The land
on the north side of the river should be taken up by
the state for public uses of this international development
scheme on the same basis as at our Projected
Ports.</p>

<h4>c. Wuhu</h4>

<p>Wuhu is a town of 120,000 inhabitants and is the
center of the rice trade in the lower part of the Yangtze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
It is at this point that I propose to make an intake of
the water which will go to flush the Whangpoo River
at Shanghai, and which will form the upper end of a
canal to the sea at Chapu. In the regulating work of
the Yangtze the concave part above the junction of the
Yangki Ho has to be filled up and the convex part of
the opposite side has to be cut away. The junction of
the projected canal and the river will be at about a mile
or so below the Lukiang junction. The projected canal
will run northeast to a point between the southeast
corner of Wuhu city and the foot of the hill. There
it joins the Yangki Ho and, following the course as
far as Paichiatien, branches off in the northeastern
direction. This gives Wuhu a southeast waterfront
along the left side of the canal. New bunds should be
built along both sides of the canal as well as alongside
the Yangtze and at the junction of the canal docks for
inland vessels should be constructed with modern plants
for transhipment of goods. Wide streets should be
laid out from the Bund of the Yangtze far into the
inland following the direction of the canal. The bund
alongside the Yangtze should be reserved for commercial
purposes and those alongside the canal for factories.
Wuhu is in the midst of a rich iron and coal
field, so it will surely become an industrial center when
this iron and coal field is properly developed. Cheap
materials, cheap labor, and cheap foodstuffs are abundant
at the spot waiting for modern science and
machinery to turn them into greater wealth for the
benefit of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<h4>d. Anking and South Side</h4>

<p>Anking, the capital of Anhwei, was once a very important
city but since its destruction by the Taiping war
it has never recovered its former greatness. Its present
population is about 40,000 only. Its immediate neighborhood
is very rich in mineral and agricultural products.
The great tea district of Liu-an and the rich
mineral district in the southeastern corner of Honan
province will have to make Anking their shipping port
when railways are developed. In the Yangtze Conservancy
work, the concave turn of the river in front
and west of the city has to be filled up. This reclaimed
land should be for the extension of a new city, where
modern transportation plants should be built.</p>

<p>Eagle Point, on the south side opposite Anking
should be cut away to make the river curve more gently
and to give the channel a uniform width. A new city
should be laid out at this point, for from here we command
the vast tea districts of southern Anhwei and
western Chekiang. The rich inland city of Hweichow,
with the highly productive country around it, will have
to make this port its shipping station. As Wuhu is the
center of the rice trade these twin cities of Anking will
be the centers of the tea trade. Like Wuhu, these twin
cities are also situated in the midst of rich iron and
coal fields which will assist them to become important
industrial centers in the near future. So to build twin
cities at this point of the river will be a very profitable
undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<h4>e. The Poyang Port</h4>

<p>I propose to construct a port at a point between the
Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River. This will be the
sole port of the Kiangsi province. Every city of this
province is connected by natural waterways which, if
improved, will become a splendid water transportation
system. The province of Kiangsi has a population of
30,000,000 and is extremely rich in mineral resources.
A modern port acting as a commercial and industrial
center for the development of this resourceful province
would be a most remunerative proposition in our
project.</p>

<p>The site of the port will be on the west side of the
entrance to the Poyang Lake and the right bank of the
Yangtze. It will be an entirely new city built on new
ground, part of which will be reclaimed from the shallow
side of the lake. In the regulating work of the
Poyang Channel, a training wall should be built from
the foot of the Taku Tang Hill to Swain Point opposite
to Stone Bell Hill of Hukow. A closed dock should be
constructed within this training wall for the accommodation
of inland water vessels. The city should be
laid out on the triangular space formed by the right
bank of the Yangtze, the left side of the Poyang Lake
and the foot hill of the Lushan Mountain. This triangle
is about 10 miles on each side, excellent for city development.
The porcelain industry should be established
here instead of at Kingteh Chen, for great
damages often occur owing to the lack of transportation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
facilities, and to the necessity of transhipment for
the export of the finished articles from the latter place.
Modern plants on a large scale should be adopted for
the manufacturing of cheap wares as well as fine articles
in our projected Poyang Port, for here we shall
have the greater advantage of collecting raw materials
than at Kingteh Chen. Thus the concentrating of the
various manufactures in an advantageous center will
result in quickening the growth of our new city. This
Poyang Port is bound to grow into one of the great
commercial and manufacturing centers in China, judging
from the possibilities of Kiangsi alone. It will not
only be a great shipping port of the Yangtze but will
also be a railway center between North and South
China. Thus to develop this port on a large scale is
quite justifiable from an economic point of view.</p>

<h4>f. Wuhan</h4>

<p>Wuhan signifies the three cities of Wuchang, Hankow,
and Hanyang. This point is the headwater of
our projected ocean passage, the pivot of the railway
system of China Proper, and will become the most
important commercial metropolis in the country. The
population of these three cities is over a million and
could be easily doubled or trebled if improvements
would be made. At present, Hanyang possesses the
largest iron works in China, and Hankow, many
modern industries, while Wuchang is becoming a great
cotton manufacturing city. Besides, Hankow is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
trade center of Central and West China, and the
greatest tea market we have. The provinces of Hupeh,
Hunan, Szechuen, and Kweichow and a part of Honan,
Shensi, and Kansu all depend upon Hankow as their
only port in the outside world. When railways are developed
in China, Wuhan will be still more important
and will surely become one of the greatest cities in the
world. So in planning the future city of Wuhan we
must adopt for its development a scale as large as that
of New York or London.</p>

<p>In the regulation of the Yangtze embankments, we
have to reclaim the front of Hankow from the jetty of
Lungwangmiao at the junction of the Han River right
along the left bank to the point where the Yangtze
turns eastward. This reclaimed space will be at an
average of about 500 to 600 yards wide. This will
narrow down the river at this part to give a uniform
channel of 5 to 6 cables in width and to give the Hankow
settlement a strip of valuable land along its waterfront.
This will also help to pay a part of the expenses
for city construction. The sharp bend of the Han River
just before it joins the Yangtze should be straightened
so as to make a gentler curve around Lungwangmiao
Point and thus enable the currents of both rivers to
flow in the same direction at their junction. The Hanyang
embankment will follow pretty closely the present
shore line but not beyond the iron works jetty. The
wide space of the river above Wuchang city should be
walled in to make a closed dock for inland water as well
as ocean going vessels. Below Wuchang, an embankment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
parallel to that of the left side should be built so
as to make the future city extend far below the present
one. A tunnel should be constructed to connect both
embankments at a point where the Kinghan railway
makes its first turn when it comes to the Yangtze River.
And another tunnel or bridge should be constructed
between Hankow and Hanyang on one side and
Wuchang on the other at the junction of the Han River
and the Yangtze. Additional tunnels or bridges may
be constructed at different points when the city grows
larger in the future. All the outlying land of these
trio-cities should be taken up on the same basis as at
our projected seaports, so that private monopoly and
speculation in land may be prevented, and that the
unearned increment will go to the State to help the
payment of capital and interest on the foreign loans
which are to be made in this international development
scheme.</p>

<h3>PART IV<br />

<span class="subhead">The Improvement of the Existing Waterways
and Canals</span></h3>

<p>The existing waterways and canals in connection
with the Yangtze may be enumerated as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Grand Canal.</li>
<li>b. The Hweiho.</li>
<li>c. The Kiangnan Waterway System.</li>
<li>d. The Poyang Waterway System.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></li>
<li>e. The Han River.</li>
<li>f. The Tungting System.</li>
<li>g. The Upper Yangtze.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Grand Canal</h4>

<p>The Grand Canal connects with the Yangtze at a
point opposite Chinkiang and runs northward right up
to Tientsin, a distance of over 600 miles. We understand
that a detailed survey of the Kiangpeh part of the
canal has begun and the work of improving it will commence
soon. In our project, I propose to substitute the
Kiangpeh portion of the Grand Canal by the Yangtze
outlet of the Hweiho.</p>

<h4>b. The Hweiho</h4>

<p>The Hweiho rises in the northwest corner of Honan
and runs southeast and east to the north of Anhwei and
Kiangsu. Its outlets have been sealed up in recent
years so its water has accumulated in the Hungtse
Lake and it depends upon evaporation as its only means
of disposing the water. Thus in the heavy rainy season,
it floods a vast extent of the country surrounding
the lake and causes great misery to millions of people.
So the conservancy of the Hweiho is a very urgent
question of China to-day. Recently many investigations
have been made and many plans proposed. Mr.
Jameson, chief engineer for the American Red Cross
Society, has proposed two outlets for the Hweiho:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
one following the old course of the Yellow River to
the sea and another through Paoying and Kao-yu
Lakes to the Yangtze. In this project I propose to
follow Mr. Jameson's plan for the sea outlet only as far
as the old Yellow River and for the Yangtze outlet only
as far as Yangchow. When the sea outlet or north
branch reaches the old Yellow River I will lead it across
into the Yenho and follow the Yenho to its northern
turn. From there, we cut across the narrow strip of
land into the Kuanho which enters the sea at the nearest
deep water line. This saves a great deal of work of
excavating the old course of the Hoangho. When the
southern branch reaches Yangchow, I propose to make
the canal pass east of that city instead of west as Mr.
Jameson proposed, so that its current will join the
Yangtze in the same direction at the new curve below
Chinkiang city.</p>

<p>Both of these outlets or branches of the Hweiho
should be made at least twenty feet deep right along,
so that coastal vessels from the north to the Yangtze
could use them as passage instead of going round the
Yangtze estuary, thus shortening the distance by about
300 miles. And with twenty feet depth for both outlets,
the Hweiho and the Hungtse Lake would be well
drained and the present bottom of the lake, which is
sixteen feet above sea level would be converted into
agricultural land at once. Thus 6,000,000 mow of
land could be reclaimed according to the estimate of
Mr. Jameson, from the Hungtse and the neighboring
lakes. If twenty dollars a mow be taken for its value,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
a sum of $120,000,000 could be netted. Besides this
direct profit to the Government, there is an area of
some 17,000 square miles of occasionally flooded land
which would be made flood-proof so that normally we
shall have two crops a year instead of two only in five
years. That is to say, the 17,000 square miles or
10,880,000 acres will be made to produce five times
more than at present. For instance, if the value of the
gross production be estimated at fifty dollars an acre,
then the total value would be $544,000,000 Mex. and
five times this sum would amount to $2,720,000,000
Mex. What an enormous profit to the country!</p>

<h4>c. The Kiangnan Waterway System</h4>

<p>This system comprises the South Grand Canal, the
Whangpoo, the Taihu, and its connections. The most
important improvement I intend to make here is to
widen and deepen the Wuhu-Ihsing Waterway between
the Yangtze and the Taihu, and from there to
dredge a deep channel right through the Taihu to a
point midway of the Grand Canal between Suchow and
Kashing. At Kashing, divide it into two branches:&mdash;one
following the Kashing Sunkiang Canal to Whangpoo,
and the other, to the Projected Port at Chapu.
This waterway between the Yangtze and the Whangpoo,
before it reaches Shanghai, should be made as
wide and deep as possible so as to make it carry sufficient
water to flush the Shanghai harbor as well as to
provide a shorter passage for inland water vessels between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the Yangtze and the seaports. This waterway
will act as silt carrier by which the Taihu and the
various lakes alongside of it may be reclaimed in the
future. Besides the main object for which this canal
is assigned, the reclamation scheme and the local traffic
would also add profit to it. This makes its remuneration
doubly sure. As no accurate surveys of the
shallow Taihu and other lakes and swamps could be
obtained, the exact number of mow to be reclaimed
could not be given here. But in a rough estimate I
should say that the reclaimed space of the Kiangnan
Lakes would be about the same in extent as those of
Kiangpeh (the North of the Yangtze).</p>

<h4>d. The Poyang Waterway System</h4>

<p>This system drains the entire area of Kiangzi province.
Every hsien, city, and important town is reached
by waterway. Waterways are the only means of communication
in this province as well as in all the
provinces of Southeastern China, before the advent of
railways. The lower part of the Kiangsi waterway
system suffers the same irregularities as those of the
lower Yangtze as both are on low land. So, to regulate
it, a similar work as that for the Yangtze should be
applied. The Poyang Lake should be divided by deep
channels from the junction of each river, and these
should join together to form larger channels and finally
unite into one main channel at a point near Chuki and,
running through the narrow part of the lake, join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Yangtze at Hukow. The sides of the deep channels
should be lined with submerged stone ridges as high as
the shallow part of the lake, whereby the channels
would serve the purpose of draining as well as of
navigation.</p>

<p>The shallow space beside those channels will be reclaimed
into arable land in due time. So the work of
regulating the Poyang channels will be well paid by
reclamation.</p>

<h4>e. The Han River</h4>

<p>This river is navigable for small crafts through its
main body up to Hanchung in the southwest corner of
Shensi; and through its branches up to Nanyang and
Shekichen in the southwest corner of Honan. This
navigable stream commands quite a large area of
watershed. The upper part, that is above Siangyang,
is in mountainous country. From Siangyang to Shayang
it is in a wide, open valley and below Shayang it
runs into the Hupeh swamp.</p>

<p>To improve this river dams should be built above
Siangyang in order to utilize water power as well as to
make locks for larger crafts to ascend to the navigable
point now navigable only for small crafts. Below
Siangyang, where the river is very wide and shallow,
rudimental dikes should be constructed of stones or
piles in order to restrict its channel and to reclaim the
shallow space on both sides by natural process. In the
swamp, the river should be straightened and deepened.
A new canal between the Han and the Yangtze at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Shasi should be constructed to provide a shorter passage
between Hankow and Shasi and beyond. This
canal in the swamp should be open to the lakes along
its course so as to let the silt-carrying water enter into
them in the flood season, thus filling them up quicker.</p>

<h4>f. The Tungting System</h4>

<p>This system of waterway drains the whole province
of Hunan and beyond. The most important branches
are the Siangkiang and the Yuankiang. The former
runs through Hunan into the northeast corner of
Kwangsi province and connects with the Sikiang
system by a canal near Kweilin. The latter runs across
the west border of Hunan into the eastern part of
Kweichow province. Both could be improved for the
navigation of large crafts. The canal between the
Yangtze and the Sikiang watersheds should be reconstructed
and modern locks should be provided in it as
well as along the two waterways. Thus, vessels of ten
feet draught may freely pass between the Yangtze and
the Sikiang. The Tungting Lake should be drained by
deep channels in the same manner as the Poyang Lake,
and its shallow space reclaimed by natural process.</p>

<h4>g. The Upper Yangtze</h4>

<p>I include the part from Hankow to Ichang also in the
Upper Yangtze, because it is at Hankow that the ocean
navigation ends, and the inland water communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
begins. So, in dealing with the improvement of the
Upper Yangtze, I will begin at Hankow. At present
the Upper Yangtze is navigable for shallow draught
steamers up to Kiating, a point about 1,100 miles above
Hankow by river. If improvement be made farther on,
than shallow draught steamers could navigate right
up to Chengtu, the capital of Szechuen province, and
the center of the richest plain in West China, about
sixty miles up the Min River.</p>

<p>To improve the Upper Yangtze from Hankow to
Yochow, the work is much similar to that of the lower
part. The channel should be regulated by rudimental
dikes. The concave embankments in sharp bends
should be protected by stone or concrete; obstacles in
midstream should be removed. The great loop, called
the Farmer Bend, above Kinkow, should be cut through
at the neck of Paichow, and the sharp point of Hanchin
Kwang should be cut away to make the curve of the
river more gentle.</p>

<p>The tortuous part of the Yangtze, north of the Tungting
Lake, between Kinho Kow and Skipper Point,
should be blocked up altogether and a new channel
made through Tungting Lake, returning to the Yangtze
by the Yochow Channel. This avoids the crooked
passage and shortens the river course considerably.
From Skipper Point to Ichang the dilatations should be
restricted by dikes of stone or piling, and some sharp
points of the shores should be cut away to make the
curves more gentle.</p>

<p>The Yangtze River above Ichang enters the Gorges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
which run about a hundred miles up to the Szechuen
depression, known as the Red Basin. This part of the
river from Ichang right along to its source is confined
by rocky banks, very narrow and deep, having an average
depth of six fathoms and at some particular points
even thirty fathoms. Many rapids and obstructions
occur along its course.</p>

<p>To improve the Upper Yangtze, the rapids should
be dammed up to form locks to enable crafts to ascend
the river as well as to generate water power. Obstructions
should be blasted and boulders removed. Thus,
a ten-foot channel right along from Hankow to
Chungking could be obtained so that through inland
water transportation could be established from Chungking
to Peking in the north and to Canton in the south,
as well as to all navigable points in China Proper all
the year round. In this way, transportation expenses
to the richest emporium in West China could be reduced
hundredfold. The benefit to the people will be
enormous and the encouragement to commerce will
indeed be great.</p>

<h3>PART V<br />

<span class="subhead">The Establishment of Large Cement Works</span></h3>

<p>Steel and cement are the basis of modern construction,
and the most important factors of the material
civilization of the present age. In the various projects
of our development scheme, the demand for steel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
cement will be so enormous that all manufacturing
countries combined will not be able to supply the needs.
Therefore, in our first program, I have proposed to
establish large steel works in the rich iron and coal
fields in the provinces of Shansi and Chili; so in this
second program I propose to establish large cement
works along the shores of the Yangtze River. The
Yangtze Valley is exceptionally rich in materials for
cement,&mdash;limestone and coal lying side by side at the
water edge along the navigable channel from Chinkiang
upward. Thus, local supplies could be created for
local needs.</p>

<p>At present, there is one cement works at Shihuiyau
near Hoangshikang at the upper reach. It is situated
between a deep water wharf and a limestone hill. The
limestone is so near by that it can be cut and shoveled
into the kilns immediately. Between Hankow and
Kiukiang there are many places possessing the same
advantage. Below Kiukiang, there are also many such
advantageous positions as Matang, Wushiki and many
others between Kiukiang and Anking. Between Anking
and Nanking there are exceptionally good locations
for putting up cement works such as Tatung, Tikang,
and Tsaishisze, all these places being provided abundantly
with limestone and coal and iron, lying side by
side.</p>

<p>With the huge harbor works, city building, and
embankment construction, the market for cement will
be so great that a capital of one to two hundred million
dollars should be invested for the supply. This work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
should be started gradually in accord with the acceleration
of the other works of the general development so
that one project will further the other, and over-production
and waste of capital individually in any of the
parts of the general scheme will be guarded against.
This will help make each of them a profitable business
by itself.</p>

<h2><a name="PROGRAM_III" id="PROGRAM_III">PROGRAM III</a></h2>

<p>The main feature of the third program will be the
construction of a great southern port which will complete
the plan for three first-class seaports in China as
proposed in the preliminary part of this International
Development Scheme. Our Great Southern Port will
naturally be Canton, which is not only the center of
commerce in South China but also the largest city in
all China. Until recent times it was the largest city on
the coasts of the Pacific, and the center of commerce
of Asia. With the development of China, Canton will
surely resume its former importance. Around this
southern metropolis I formulate the third program as
follows:</p>

<h3>PART I<br />

<span class="subhead">The Improvement of Canton as a World Port</span></h3>

<p>Canton's position as a seaport has been taken away
by Hongkong since its cession to England after the
Opium War. But as a commercial center of South
China, Canton still holds its own, despite the advantages
of deep-water harbor, the artificial improvements
of Hongkong, and the political dominance of England.
The loss of its position as a seaport is entirely due to
the ignorance of the Chinese people who never made
any combined effort to improve the welfare of the
country, and also to the corrupt government and officials
of the Manchu dynasty. Since the establishment
of the Republic, the people have begun to awake very
rapidly and many schemes have been suggested to make
Canton a seaport. This awakening of the millions of
Chinese has caused much apprehension to the Hongkong
Government. The authorities of that colony have
been doing their utmost to hinder every move to restore
Canton as a seaport and try to nip every scheme in the
bud. Of course, if Canton is improved and made into
a world port, then all the services that Hongkong performs
for her as a shipping stage would be dispensed
with altogether. But a developed Canton and a prosperous
China will recompense Hongkong in various
ways a hundred times more than its present position as
the monopolized ocean port of a backward and poor
China. Just look at the port of Victoria in British Columbia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
which was once the only seaport of West Canada
as well as the Northwestern region of the United
States, but it prospered very little then with an undeveloped
hinterland despite its monopolistic character.
Whereas as soon as the rival ports arose, Vancouver on
its own side, and Seattle and Tacoma on the American
side, all within the same distance as Hongkong is to
Canton, all of them because of a developed hinterland
prospered wonderfully, despite the keen competition
between them as seaports. Thus, we see that competitive
seaports like Vancouver, Seattle, and Tacoma
instead of killing Victoria, as was once supposed by
shortsighted people, have made it more prosperous than
ever. Then, why doubt that a prosperous Canton and a
developed China would not give the same result to
Hongkong? This is but a natural outcome. Therefore,
there should be no fear that a prosperous Canton
and a developed China would be harmful to Hongkong
as a free port. So, instead of doing the utmost as
hitherto to hinder the development of Canton as a seaport,
the Hongkong authorities should do their utmost
to encourage such a project. Besides, the development
of Canton and South China will benefit the English as
a whole commercially a hundred times more than
Hongkong can do at present. Although the local
authorities of that crown colony do not see far enough
to realize it, however, I believe that the great statesmen
and captains of industries in the now mightiest empire
of the world would surely see it. With this belief in
my mind I feel quite safe in giving publicity to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
scheme of my international development of Canton as
a world port in South China.</p>

<p>Canton is situated at the head of the Canton Delta,
which is formed by the junction of three rivers&mdash;the
Sikiang or West River, the Peikiang or North River,
and the Tungkiang or East River. The area of this
delta is about 3,000 square miles and it has the most
fertile alluvial soil known in China. The land yields
three crops a year&mdash;two crops of rice and one crop of
other products such as potatoes or beets. In silk
culture, it gives eight crops every year. The most
delicious fruits of many varieties are produced in
this delta. This is the most thickly populated district
of all China. Within this delta and its immediate
neighborhood, more than half of the population of
Kwangtung province is found. This is the reason why,
despite the great productivity of this fertile delta,
large quantities of foods have to be supplied by the
surrounding country as well as by foreign imports.
Before the age of machinery Canton for centuries was
well known as an industrial center of Eastern Asia. The
workmanship and handicraft of its people are still unequaled
in many parts of the world. If machinery
will be introduced in its industries under our international
development scheme, Canton will soon recover
its former grandeur as a great manufacturing center.</p>

<p>As a world port, Canton is in a most advantageous
position. Being situated at the junction of three navigable
rivers and at the head of the ocean navigation it
is a pivot of inland water as well as ocean communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
in South China. If the Southwestern railway
system is completed, then Canton will be equal in importance
to the two great ports in North and East
China, in regard to transportation facilities. The ocean
approach of Canton is generally deep excepting at two
points which can be easily trained and dredged to enable
modern liners to pass in and out at any hour. The
deep water line of the ocean reaches up to Lingting
Island, where the depth is from 8 to 10 fathoms.
Above Lingting, the channel gets shallower (about 3 or
4 fathoms) and runs about 15 miles up to the Fumen
Entrance. From this point the water becomes deep
again (between 6 and 10 fathoms) right up to the
Second Bar&mdash;a distance of 20 miles. At the Second
Bar, the water is about 18 to 20 feet deep for only a
few hundred yards. After crossing the Second Bar,
the water becomes deep again for a distance of 10 miles
averaging about 30 feet deep up to the First Bar which
will be the city limit of our future Canton.</p>

<p>To improve the Approach to Canton, I suggest that
two submerged training walls be built at the left side
of Canton Estuary above Lingting Island&mdash;one from
the shore to the head of the Kongsu Bank, and another
from the end of the same bank to the head of the Lingting
Bank. The first training wall will be 3 to 4 feet
under water just at the same level of the bank. The
second wall will be from 4 feet at one end to 16 feet
at the other, which are the levels of the respective banks
which it connects. (See (1) (3) Map XI.) It will cross
a channel of 24 feet deep between them. These two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
walls together with the four-foot Kongsu Bank will
act as one continuous wall and will direct the undercurrent
which now runs between the left shore and
Lingting Bank, into the middle part of the estuary,
thus cutting a channel between the bar and the bank
of the same name to meet the deep water on the west
side of Lingting Island. On the right side of the Canton
Estuary, a training wall should be built from the
lower part of Fraser Bank in a southeasterly direction
across the 24-foot channel into the Lingting Bar ending
at the east edge of that bar. (See (2) Map XI.)
Thus, with these submerged walls on both sides of the
estuary to confine the undercurrent in the middle, a
very deep channel can be formed to connect with the
Fumen Entrance at one end and the Lingting trough
at the other both of which are about 50 feet deep so
that a thoroughfare from deep sea right up to the Second
Bar of the Pearl River will be created.</p>

<p>These submerged sea walls taken together are about
8 miles in length and will be built only 6 to 12 feet
from the bottom of the sea. The expenses will not be
much while the acceleration of the natural reclamation
process will be very great. Thus, the lands that will be
formed on both sides by these walls will far more than
repay the expenses of the work of building these
walls.</p>

<div id="ip_82" class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
  <img src="images/map_xi.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="Map XI" /><br /></div>

<p>To regulate the Approach of Canton, in that part of
the Pearl River from the Fumen Entrance to Whampoa,
I suggest that the East River Estuaries be concentrated
in a single outlet by using the uppermost channel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
which joins the Pearl River at the lower point of
Davids Island. The other outlets of the East River,
which joins the Pearl River below the Second Bar,
should be closed up by dams built to the height of the
normal water level so as to permit them to serve as flood
channels in the rainy season. By concentrating the
whole volume of water of the East River above the
Second Bar, a stronger current could be obtained to
flush the upper part of this section of the river.</p>

<div id="ip_83" class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
  <img src="images/map_xii.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="Map XII" /><br /></div>

<p>In the training works of this section, I propose that
several jetties should be built as follows: First, a jetty
from Elliot Island at point (A) to the farther side of
Calcutta Shoal opposite the lower point of Parker Island.
This will block the current between Elliot Island
and Calcutta Shoal and divert it into the present 36-foot
channel thus making it deeper by its natural force.
Second, another jetty from Bolton Island, at point (B)
to midstream terminating at the lower side of the Second
Bar, on the right side of the river. Third, a jetty
from the lower point of Pattinger Island at (C) to
midstream terminating at the lower side of the same
bar on the left side of the river. Thus the Second
Bar would be flushed by the concentrated current
created by these two jetties. The shallow bottom
above these jetties should be dredged to the required
depth. If a rocky bottom is found at this
bar it should be blasted and removed, so as to give a
uniform depth to the whole approach. Fourth, the
channel between the right bank of the river and Bolton
Island should be blocked up at (D). Fifth, a jetty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
from Pattinger Island at (E) to the head of the Second
Bar Bank in midstream so as to cut off the current at
the left side of the river and to increase the velocity
in the middle channel. Sixth, a jetty from the right
shore at (F) about midway between Danes Island and
the Second Bar, should be built to the head of the Midstream
Shoal so as to cut off the current at the right
side of the river. And seventh, another jetty from
the lower point of Davids Island at (G) to midstream
opposite to the end of jetty (F). Jetties (G) and (F)
will concentrate the current of the upper Pearl River
while at the same time jetty (G) will also turn the East
River current into the same direction as that of the
Pearl River. (See Map XII.)</p>

<p>By these seven jetties, the current between Whampoa
and Fumen could be controlled and the bottom of the
river flushed to a depth of 40 feet or more, thus creating
a thoroughfare for ocean-going steamers from the
open sea right up to the city of Canton. These jetties
taken together will be not more than 5 miles in length
and mostly in very shallow water. After the building
of these jetties, land will be rapidly formed between
jetties along both sides of the channel by natural
process. The reclaimed land alone will be quite
enough to pay the expenses of constructing these jetties,
aside from the fact that the main object of regulating
the river and opening up a deep channel for ocean
transportation will have been realized.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the approach to Canton, we may
now take up the improvement of Canton City itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
as a world port. The harbor limit of Canton will be
at the First Bar. From there, the harbor will follow
the deep water of Cambridge Reach and the water
between Whampoa and Danes Island into American
Reach. At this point it will cut through Actaeon Island
to the south of Honam Island and follow the Elliot
Passage to Mariners Island. From Mariners Island
following the Fatshan Creek, a straight channel should
be cut in a southwesterly direction to the Tamchow
Channel. Thus, a new waterway will be made from
the First Bar to Tamchow Channel, a distance of about
25 miles. This waterway will be the main outlet of the
North River as well as a thoroughfare for the West
River, and will also serve as the harbor of Canton.
By conveying all the water of the North River and a
part of that of the West River through this waterway,
the current will be strong enough to flush the harbor
to a depth of 40 feet or more. (See Map XIII.)</p>

<p>The new city of Canton will be extended from
Whampoa to Fatshan, separated by the Macao Fort
and Shameen Reaches. The section that lies east of
this water should be developed into commercial
quarters and that west of it into factory quarters.
The factory section should be transected by canals
connecting with the Fati and Fatshan creeks so as to
give cheap transportation facilities to every factory.
In the commercial section, tidal wharves with modern
plants and warehouses should be provided. A bund
should be built from the First Bar Island along the
north side of the new waterway, the west side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Honam to connect with the bund of Shameen, and the
northwestern side of Canton city. Another bund
should be built from above Fati along the east side
of Fati Island to Mariners Island thence turning
southwest along the left bank of the new waterway.
The Front Reach, that is, the river between the present
Canton city and Honam Island should be filled up
from the upper point of Honam to Whampoa for
city building.</p>

<div id="ip_86" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/map_xiii.jpg" width="600" height="417" alt="Map XIII" /><br /></div>

<p>In regard to the question of remuneration, the development
of Canton as a world port will be the most
profitable undertaking of the kind in the International
Development Scheme. Because, besides its commanding
position as a commercial metropolis and its possession
of advantageous facilities as a manufacturing
center of South China, a modern residential city is in
great demand in this part of the country. The well-to-do
people and merchants of this rich delta as well
as those retired Chinese merchants and millionaires
abroad all over the world are very eager to spend
their remaining days at home. But owing to the lack
of modern conveniences and comforts they reluctantly
remain in foreign countries. Thus to build a new city
with modern equipments for residential purposes
alone, in Canton, would pay splendidly. The land
outside of Canton is at present about 200 dollars a
mow. If the land marked off for the future city of
Canton should be taken up by the State on the same
basis as elsewhere in this International Development
Scheme, immediately after the streets are laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
and improvements made, the price of land would rise
from ten to fifty times its original value.</p>

<div id="ip_87" class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
  <img src="images/map_xiv.jpg" width="423" height="600" alt="Map XIV" /><br /></div>

<p>The landscape of the environment of Canton is exceptionally
beautiful and charming. It is an ideal
place for planning a garden city with attractive parks.
The location of the city of Canton resembles that of
Nanking but is of greater magnitude and beauty. It
possesses three natural elements&mdash;deep water, high
mountains, and vast extent of level land which furnish
facilities for an industrial and commercial center
and provide as well natural scenery for the enjoyment
of man. The beautiful valleys and hills of the
northern shore of the Pearl River could be laid out
for ideal winter resorts and the high mountain tops
could be utilized for summer resorts.</p>

<p>Within the city limits at the northwest corner, a
rich coal field has been found. When the coal is
mined and modern plants for generating electricity
and producing gas are provided, then cheap electricity
and gas could be had for transportation, for manufacturing,
for lighting, heating, and cooking purposes.
And so the present wasteful methods of transportation,
and expensive fuels for manufacturing and
cooking for the populous city of Canton can be done
away with entirely. Thus great economic wonders
could be wrought by such improvements. The present
population of Canton is over a million and if our development
plan is carried out, this city would grow in
leaps and bounds within a very short time. The population
will become greater than any other city and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
profit of our undertaking will become correspondingly
large.</p>

<h3>PART II<br />

<span class="subhead">The Improvement of the Waterway System of Canton</span></h3>

<p>The most important waterway system in South
China is the Canton system. Besides this the others
are not of much importance and will be dealt with
elsewhere with their ports. In dealing with the Canton
system of waterways, I have to divide it as
follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Canton Delta.</li>
<li>b. The West River.</li>
<li>c. The North River.</li>
<li>d. The East River.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Canton Delta</h4>

<p>To improve the Canton Delta we have to consider
the proposition from three points of view: First,
the problem of flood prevention; second, the problem
of navigation; and third, the problem of reclamation.
Each of these problems affects the others so the solution
of one will help that of the others.</p>

<p>First, the problem of flood prevention. The frequent
repetition of floods in recent years has wrought
great disasters to the people in the neighborhood of
Canton. It has destroyed lives by the thousands and
property by the millions. The part which suffers most
is the country between Canton and Lupao, lying just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
immediately north of the Canton Delta. This fatal
spot is, I think, created by the silting up of the main
outlet of the North River immediately below Sainam.
On account of this, the North River has to find its
outlets through the West River by the short canal at
Samshui and through two small streams one from
Sainam, and another from Lupao. The former runs
in a northeasterly direction and the latter in a southeasterly
direction and they join at Kuanyao. From
this point, the river takes a northeasterly course as
far as Kumli, thence, turning southeast, passes the
west suburb of Canton. Since the North River is
silted up below Sainam, its channel above that spot
is also getting shallower every year. At present the
river above Samshui city is only about four or five
feet deep. When the North River rises its water generally
finds its way into the West River through the
Kongkun Canal. But if the West River should rise
at the same time, then there would be no outlet for
the North River and its water would accumulate until
it overflowed its dikes above and below Lupao. This
would naturally cause the dikes to break at some point
and allow the water to rush out and flood the whole
country that is meant to be protected by these dikes.
The remedy for the North River is to reopen the main
outlet below Sainam and have the whole channel
dredged deep from Tsingyuen to the sea. Fortunately,
in our improvement of the navigation of the Canton
Delta, we have to do the same thing; so this one work
will serve two purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
The remedy for the West River is that the shallow
part just at its junction with the sea between Wangkum
and Sanchoo Islands should be trained by walls
on both sides&mdash;a long one on the left, and a short one
on the right&mdash;so as to concentrate the current to cut
the river bed here to a depth of twenty feet or more.
In this way, a uniform depth is secured, for after
passing the Moto Entrance the West River has an
average depth of 20 to 30 feet right along its whole
course through this delta. With a uniform depth all
the way to the sea, the undercurrent will run quickly
and drain off the flood water more rapidly. Besides
the deepening process, both shores should be regulated
so as to give a uniform width to the channel. Midstream
shoals and islands should be removed.</p>

<p>The East River Valley does not suffer so severely
from floods as those of the other two rivers, the West
and the North, and its remedy will be provided in
the regulation of the river for navigation. This will
be dealt with in that connection.</p>

<div id="ip_90" class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
  <img src="images/map_xv.jpg" width="420" height="600" alt="Map XV" /><br /></div>

<p>Second, the problem of navigation in the Canton
Delta in connection with the three rivers. In dealing
with this question we commence with the West
River. In former days the traffic between the West
River Valley and Canton always passed through Fatshan
and Samshui, a distance of about 35 miles. But
since the silting up of the Fatshan Channel below Sainam,
the traffic has to take a great detour by descending
the Pearl River southeastward as far as Fumen, then
turn northwest into the Shawan Channel, then southeast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
into the Tamchow Channel, and then west into the
Tailiang Channel and south into the Junction Channel
and Maning Reach. Here it enters into the West
River and runs a northwesterly direction up to Samshui
Junction on this river. The whole journey covers
a distance of about 95 miles, which compared with
the old route is longer by 60 miles. The traffic between
Canton and the West River Valley is very
great. At present there are many thousands of
steam launches plying between Canton City and the
outlying districts, and more than half of that number
are carrying traffic to and fro on the West River.
Every boat has to run 95 miles on each trip whereas
if the channel between Samshui and Canton is improved,
the distance would be only 35 miles. What
a great saving it will be!</p>

<div id="ip_91" class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
  <img src="images/map_xvi.jpg" width="430" height="600" alt="Map XVI" /><br /></div>

<p>In our project to improve the Canton Approach and
Harbor, I suggested the draining of a deep channel
from the sea to Whampoa and from Whampoa to
Tamchow Channel. We now have to prolong this
channel from its Tamchow Junction up to Samshui
Junction on the West River. This Channel should
be made at least 20 feet deep so as to join the deeper
water of the West River above the Samshui Junction.
And the same depth should be maintained in the North
River itself some distance above Samshui, so as to
give facility for the navigation of larger vessels up
the river when the whole waterway is improved.</p>

<p>To improve the East River for navigation in the
Canton Delta we should concentrate the current of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
estuaries into one single outlet by using the right
channel which joins the Pearl River at Davids Island,
thus deepening the channel as well as shortening the
distance between Canton and the East River districts
when the upper part of the river is improved.</p>

<p>Another improvement in the Canton Delta for
navigation is the opening of a straight canal between
Canton City and Kongmoon so as to shorten the passage
of the heavy traffic between this metropolis and
the Szeyap districts. This canal should begin by
straightening the Chanchun Creek south of Canton as
far as Tsznai. Then crossing the Tamchow Channel
it should enter into the Shuntuck Creek and follow
this creek to its end emerging into the Shuntuck
Branch at right angles. From there, a new canal
must be cut straight to the turn of the Tailiang Channel
near Yungki, then the canal should follow this
channel through Yellow Reach as far as the Junction
Bend. Here another new canal must be cut through
to the Hoichow Creek, then it should follow Kuchan
Channel to the main channel of the West River, and
crossing it enter into the Kongmoon Branch. Thus,
a straight canal can be formed between Canton and
Kongmoon. In order to understand the improvement
of the Canton Delta more clearly see Maps XIV and
XV.</p>

<p>Third, the problem of reclamation. A very profitable
undertaking in the Canton Delta is the reclamation
of new land. This process has been going on
for centuries. Many thousands of acres of new land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
are thus being added to cultivation from year to year.
But hitherto all the reclamation has been effected
by private enterprise only, and there are no regulations
for it. So sometimes this private enterprise
causes great detriment to public welfare such as
blocking up navigable channels and causing floods.
A glaring case is the reclamation work just above the
Moto Islands, which blocks more than half of the Main
Channel of the West River. In the regulation of the
West River, I propose to cut this new land away. In
order to protect the public welfare, the reclamation
work in this Delta must be taken up by the State and
the profits must go to defray the expenses of improving
this waterway system for navigation, as well as for the
prevention of floods. At present, the area that can be
gradually reclaimed is large in extent. On the left side
of the Canton Estuary, the available area is about 40
square miles, and on the right side, about 140 square
miles. On the estuaries of the West River from Macao
to Tongkwa Island, there is an available area of about
200 square miles. Of the 380 square miles, about
one fourth would be ready for reclamation within
the next ten years. That is to say about 95 square
miles could be reclaimed and put to cultivation
within a decade. As one square mile contains 640 acres
and one acre six mow, so 95 square miles will be equal
to 364,800 mow. As cultivated land in this part of
China generally costs more than fifty dollars a mow, so,
if fifty dollars be taken as the average rate, the value
of these 364,800 mow would amount to $18,240,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
This will help a great deal to defray the expenses of
improving the waterway for navigation and for preventing
floods in this Delta.</p>

<h4>b. The West River</h4>

<p>The West River is at present navigable for comparatively
large river steamers up to Wuchow, a distance
of 220 miles by water from Canton, and for small
steamers up to Nanning, a distance of 500 miles from
Canton, at all seasons. As for small crafts, the West
River is navigable in most of its branches, west to the
Yunnan frontier, north to Kweichow, northeast to
Hunan and the Yangtze Valley by the Shingan Canal.</p>

<p>In improving the West River for navigation I shall
divide the work into subsections as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) From Samshui to Wuchow.</p>

<p>(2) From Wuchow to the junction of the Liukiang.</p>

<p>(3) Kweikiang or the North Branch of the
West River from Wuchow to Kweilin
and beyond.</p>

<p>(4) The South Branch from Shunchow to Nanning.</p></blockquote>

<p>(1) From Samshui to Wuchow. This part of the
West River is generally deep and does not need much
improvement for vessels up to ten-foot draught excepting
at a few points. The midstream rocks should be
blasted and removed and sand banks and dilating parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
should be regulated by submerged dikes to secure a
uniform channel and to make the velocity of the current
even, so that a stable fairway could be maintained
all the year round. The traffic of this river would be
sufficiently great to pay for all the improvements which
we propose to make.</p>

<p>(2) From Wuchow to the Junction of the Liukiang.
At this junction, a river port should be built to
connect the deep navigation from the sea and the shallow
navigation of Hungshui Kiang and the Liukiang
which penetrate the rich mineral districts of Northwest
Kwangsi and Southwest Kweichow. This port
will be about fifty miles from Shunchow which is the
junction of the Nanning branch of the river. So here,
we have only to improve a distance of fifty miles, for
the improvement of the river between Shunchow and
Wuchow will be included in the plan for the Nanning
Port. Dams and locks would be necessary to make this
part of the river navigable for ten-foot draught vessels.
But these dams at the same time would serve the purpose
of producing water power.</p>

<p>(3) Kweikiang or the North Branch of the West
River from Wuchow to Kweilin and beyond. As
Kweikiang is smaller, shallower and has more rapids
along its course, so its improvement will be more difficult
than that of the other parts of the waterway. But
this will be a very profitable proposition in this Southern
waterway project, for this river not only serves the
purpose of transportation in this rich territory but will
also serve as a passage for through traffic between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Yangtze and the West River valleys. The improvement
should commence from the junction at Wuchow
up to Kweilin, and thence upward to the Shingan
Canal, then downward to the Siang River, and thereby
connecting with the Yangtze River. A series of dams
and locks should be built for vessels to ascend to the
inter-watershed canal and another series should descend
on the other side. The expenses of building
these two series of dams and locks could not be estimated
until accurate surveys are made. But I am sure
this project will be a paying one.</p>

<p>(4) From Shunchow to Nanning. This portion of
the Yuhkiang is navigable for small steamers up to
Nanning, the center of commerce in South Kwangsi.
From Nanning small crafts can navigate through the
Yuhkiang as far as the east border of Yunnan, and
through Tsokiang as far as the north border of Tongking.
If this waterway be improved up to Nanning,
then it would be the nearest deep river port for the rich
mineral districts of the whole southwest corner of
China, which includes the whole province of Yunnan,
a greater part of Kweichow and half of Kwangsi.
The immediate neighborhood of Nanning is also very
rich in minerals, such as antimony, tin, iron, coal and
also in agricultural products. So to make Nanning the
head of a deep water communication system will be a
paying proposition. To improve the waterway up to
Nanning, a few dams and locks along its course will
have to be built for vessels of ten-foot draught to go up
as well as for water power. The expense for this work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
cannot be estimated without detailed surveys but it
would probably be much less than the improvement of
Kweikiang from Wuchow to the Shingan Canal.</p>

<h4>c. The North River</h4>

<p>The North River from Samshui to Shiuchow is
about 140 miles long. The greater part of its course
is confined in the hilly districts, but after it emerges
from the Tsingyuen Gorge it comes into a wide, open
country, which connects with the plain of Canton.
Here the dangerous floods occur most often. Since the
silting up of its proper outlet below Sainam, the North
River from that point up to the gorge has become shallower
every year, so the dikes at the left side, that is,
on the side of the plain, often break thus causing the
inundation of the whole plain above Canton. Thus the
regulation of the river at this part has two aspects to be
considered: First, the prevention of floods and second,
the improvement for navigation. In dealing with the
first aspect nothing could be better than deepening the
river by dredging. In the improvement of the Canton
Approach and Harbor and also of the Canton Delta,
we have to cut a deep channel right from the deep sea
up to Sainam. In the improvement of the lower part
of the North River, we have simply to continue the
cutting process higher up until we have a deep channel,
say 15 to 20 feet as far as the Tsingyuen Gorge, either
by artificial or natural means. By this deepening of the
bottom of the river, the present height of the dikes will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
be quite enough to protect the plains from being
flooded.</p>

<p>In dealing with the second aspect, as we have already
deepened the part of the river from Sainam to the
Tsingyuen Gorge for flood prevention, we have at the
same time solved the navigation question. It has now
only the upper part to be dealt with. I propose to make
this river navigable up to Shiuchow, the center of commerce
as well as the center of the coal and iron fields
of Northern Kwangtung. To improve the part above
the gorge for navigation, dams and locks should be
built in one or two places before a ten-foot draught
vessel can ascend up to that point. Although this river
is parallel with the Hankow-Canton Railway, yet if the
coal and iron fields of Shiuchow are properly developed,
a deep waterway will still be needed for cheap transportation
of such heavy freight as iron and coal to the
coast. So to build dams for water power and to construct
locks for navigation in this river will be a profitable
undertaking as well as a necessary condition for
the development of this part of the country.</p>

<h4>d. The East River</h4>

<p>The East River is navigable for shallow crafts up
to Laolung Sze, a distance of about 170 miles from
the estuary at the lower point of Davids Island near
Whampoa. Along its upper course, rich iron and coal
deposits are found. Iron has been mined here since
time immemorial. At present most of the utensils used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
in this province are manufactured from the iron mined.
So to make a deep navigable waterway up to these iron
and coal fields will be most remunerative.</p>

<p>To improve the East River for navigation as well as
for flood prevention, I propose to start the work at the
lower point of Davids Island as stated in the improvement
of the Canton Approach. From here, a deep
channel should be dredged up to Suntang, and a mile
above that point a new channel should be opened in the
direction of Tungkun city, by connecting the various
arms of water between these two places and joining
the left branch of the East River immediately above
Tungkun city. All other channels leading from this
new channel to the Pearl River should be closed up to
normal water level so as to make these closed-up channels
serve as flood outlets in rainy seasons. Thus by
blocking up the rest of the estuaries of the East River,
all the water would form one strong current which
would dredge the river bottom deeper, and maintain the
depth permanently. The body of the river should be
trained to a uniform width right along its course up to
tidal point, and above this point, the river should be narrowed
in proportion to its volume of water. Thus the
whole river would dredge itself deep far up above Waichow
city. The railway bridge at the south side of
Shelung should be made a turning bridge so as to permit
large steamers to pass through it. Some sharp turns of
the river should be reduced to gentle curves and midstream
obstacles should be removed. The portion of the
river above Waichow should be provided with dams and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
locks so as to enable ten-foot draught vessels to ascend
as near as possible to the iron and coal fields in the
valley.</p>

<h3>PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">The Construction of the Southwestern Railway
System of China</span></h3>

<p>The southwestern part of China comprises Szechwan,
the largest and richest province of China Proper,
Yunnan, the second largest province, Kwangsi and
Kweichow which are rich in mineral resources, and a
part of Hunan and Kwangtung. It has an area of
600,000 square miles, and a population of over 100,000,000.
This large and populous part of China is
almost untouched by railways, except a French line of
narrow gauge from Laokay to Yunnanfu, covering a
distance of 290 miles.</p>

<p>There are great possibilities for railway development
in this part of the country. A network of lines
should radiate fan-like from Canton as pivot to connect
every important city and rich mineral field with
the Great Southern Port. The construction of railways
in this part of China is not only needed for the
development of Canton but also is essential for the
prosperity of all the southwestern provinces. With the
construction of railways rich mines of various kinds
could be developed and cities and towns could be built
along the lines. Developed lands are still very cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and undeveloped lands and those with mining possibilities
cost almost next to nothing even though not state
owned. So if all the future city sites and mining lands
be taken up by the government before railway construction
is started, the profit would be enormous.
Thus no matter how large a sum is invested in railway
construction, the payment of its interest and principal
will be assured. Besides, the development of Canton
as a world port is entirely dependent upon this system
of railways. If there be no such network of railway
traversing the length and breadth of the southwestern
section of China, Canton could not be developed up to
our expectations.</p>

<p>The southwestern section of China is very mountainous,
except the Canton and Chengtu plains, which
have an area of from 3,000 to 4,000 square miles each.
The rest of the country is made up almost entirely of
hills and valleys with more or less open space here and
there. The mountains in the eastern part of this section
are seldom over 3,000 feet high but those near the
Tibetan frontier generally have an altitude of 10,000
feet or more. The engineering difficulties in building
these railways are much greater than those of the
northwestern plain. Many tunnels and loops will have
to be constructed and so the construction costs of the
railway per mile will be greater than in other parts
of China.</p>

<p>With Canton as the terminus of this system of railroads,
I propose that the following lines be constructed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Canton-Chungking line via Hunan.</li>
<li>b. The Canton-Chungking line via Hunan and Kweichow.</li>
<li>c. The Canton-Chengtu line via Kweilin and Luchow.</li>
<li>d. The Canton-Chengtu line via Wuchow and Suifu.</li>
<li>e. The Canton-Yunnanfu-Tali-Tengyueh line ending at the Burma border.</li>
<li>f. The Canton-Szemao line.</li>
<li>g. The Canton-Yamchow line ending at Tunghing, on the Annam border.</li>
</ul></div>

<h4>a. The Canton-Chungking Line via Hunan</h4>

<p>This line will start from Canton and follow the same
direction as the Canton-Hankow line as far as the
junction of the Linkiang with the North River. From
that point the railroad turns into the valley of Linkiang,
and follows the course of the river upward above
the city of Linchow. There it crosses the watershed
between the Linkiang and the Taokiang and proceeds
to Taochow, Hunan. Thence it follows the Taokiang
to Yungchow, Paoking, Sinhwa, and Shenchow, and
up to Peiho across the boundary of Hunan into
Szechwan by Yuyang. From Yuyang the line
proceeds across the mountain to Nanchuen, thence to
Chungking after crossing the Yangtze. This railway
which has a total length of about 900 miles passes
through a rich mineral and agricultural country. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the Linchow district north of Kwangtung, rich coal,
antimony, and wolfram deposits are found; in southwestern
Hunan, tin, antimony, coal, iron, copper and
silver; and at Yuyang, east of Szechwan, antimony
and quicksilver. Among agricultural products found
along this line we may mention sugar, groundnuts,
hemp, tung oil, tea, cotton, tobacco, silk, grains, etc.
There is also an abundance of timber, bamboo and
various kinds of forest products.</p>

<h4>b. The Canton-Chungking Line via Hunan and Kweichow</h4>

<p>This line is about 800 miles in length, but as it runs
in the same track with line (a) from Canton to Taochow,
a distance of about 250 miles, it leaves only 550
miles to be accounted for. This line, therefore, actually
begins at Taochow, Hunan, and goes through the
northeastern corner of Kwangsi passing by Chuanchow,
and then through the southwestern corner of
Hunan passing by Chengpu and Tsingchow. Thence
it enters into Kweichow by Sankiang and Tsingkiang
and crosses a range of hill to Chengyuan. From
Chengyuan this line has to cross the watershed between
Yuan Kiang and Wukiang to Tsunyi. From Tsunyi
it will follow the trade route which leads to Kikiang
and then crosses the Yangtze by the same bridge as line
(a) to Chungking. This railway will also pass through
rich mineral and timber districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<h4>c. The Canton-Chengtu Line via Kweilin and Luchow</h4>

<p>This line is about 1,000 miles long. It runs from
Canton directly west to Samshui, where it crosses the
North River to the mouth of Suikong. Then, it
ascends the valley of the same name to Szewui and
Kwongning. Next, it enters into Kwangsi at Waisap,
thence to Hohsien and Pinglo. From there it follows
the course of the Kweikiang up to Kweilin. Thus the
rich iron and coal fields that lie between these two
provincial capitals, Canton and Kweilin, will be tapped.
From Kweilin the road turns west to Yungning and
then proceeds to follow the Liukiang valley into Kweichow
province at Kuchow. From Kuchow it goes to
Tukiang and Pachai and following the same valley it
crosses a range of hills into Pingyueh, thence it goes
across the Yuankiang watershed into the Wukiang
valley at Wengan and Yosejen. From Yosejen it
follows the trade route through Luipien hills to Jenhwai,
Chishui, and Nachi. Then it crosses the
Yangtzekiang to Luchow. From Luchow, it runs
through Lungchang, Neikiang, Tzechow, Tseyang and
Kienchow to Chengtu. The last part of the line traverses
very rich and populous districts of the famous
Red Basin of Szechwan province. The middle portion
of this line between Kweilin and Luchow lies in a very
rich mineral country which possesses great possibilities
for further development. This line will open up a
thinly populated part for the crowded districts at both
ends of the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h4>d. The Canton-Chengtu Line via Wuchow and Suifu</h4>

<p>This line is about 1,200 miles in distance. It commences
at the west end of the Samshui bridge which
crosses the North River at that point for line (c), and
following the left bank of the West River enters the
Shiuhing Gorge to the Shiuhing city. It passes Takhing,
Wuchow, and Tahwang along the same bank.
While the river here turns southwestwards the line
turns northwestwards to Siangchow and then crosses
Liukiang to Liuchow and Kingyuan. Then it goes to
Szegenhsien and across the Kwangsi and Kweichow
border to Tushan and Tuyun. From Tuyun the line
turns more westerly to Kweiyang, the capital of
Kweichow Province. Next, it proceeds to Kiensi and
Tating and then leaving the Kweichow border at
Pichieh it enters Yunnan at Chenhiung. Turning
northward to Lohsintu and crossing the Szechwan
border at that point, it proceeds to Suifu. From Suifu
the road follows the course of the Minkiang, passes
by Kiating and enters the Chengtu plain to Chengtu,
the capital of Szechwan. This line runs from one
densely populated district to another and passes through
a wide strip of thinly populated and undeveloped
country in the middle. Along its course many rich
iron and coal fields, silver, tin, antimony, and other
valuable metal deposits are found.</p>

<h4>e. The Canton-Yunnanfu-Tali-Tengyueh Line</h4>

<p>This line is about 1,300 miles in length from Canton
to the Burma border at Tengyueh. The first 300 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
of the line from Canton to Tahwang will be the same
as line (d). From the Tahwang junction this line
branches off to Wusuan and following in a general
way the course of the Hungshui Kiang passes through
Tsienkiang and Tunglan. Then it cuts across the
southwestern corner of Kweichow province passing
by Sinyihsien and thence enters Yunnan province at
Loping and by way of Luliang to Yunnanfu, the capital
of the province. From Yunnanfu this line runs
through Tsuyung to Tali, then turns southwestwards
to Yungchang and Tengyueh ending at the Burma
border.</p>

<p>At Tunglan, near the Kweichow border in Kwangsi,
a branch line of about 400 miles should be projected.
This line should follow the Pepan Kiang valley, up to
Kotuho, and Weining. Thence it enters Yunnan at
Chaotung, and crosses the Yangtze River at Hokeow,
where it enters Szechwan. Crossing the Taliang
mountain, it goes to Ningyuan. This branch line taps
the famous copper field between Chaotung and Ningyuan,
the richest of its kind in China.</p>

<p>The main line running through the length of
Kwangsi and Yunnan from east to west, will be of
international importance, for at the frontier it will
join the Rangoon Bhamo line of the Burmese Railway
System. It will be the shortest road from India to
China. It will bring the two populous countries nearer
to each other than now. By the new way the journey
can be made in a few days, whereas by the present
sea-route it takes as many weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<h4>f. The Canton-Szemao Line</h4>

<p>This line to the border of Burma is about 1,100
miles long. It starts from south of Canton, passes
Fatshan, Kunshan, and crosses the West River from
Taipinghü to Samchowhü. Thence it proceeds to
Koming, Sinhing, and Loting. After passing Loting
it crosses the Kwangsi border at Pingho, and proceeds
to Junghsien and then westward, crossing the Yukiang
branch of the West River, to Kweihsien. Thence it
runs north of Yukiang to Nanning. At Nanning a
branch line of 120 miles should be projected. Following
the course of the Tsokiang it goes to Lungchow
where it turns southward to Chennankwan on the
Tongking border to join the French line at that point.
The main line from Nanning proceeds in the same
course as the upper Yukiang to Poseh. Then it crosses
the border into Yunnan at Poyai, and by way of
Pamen, Koukan, Tungtu and Putsitang to Amichow,
where it crosses the French Laokay-Yunnan line.
From Amichow it proceeds to Linanfu, Shihping and
Yuankiang where it crosses the river of the same name.
Thence it passes through Talang, Puerhfu and Szemao
and finally ends at the border of Burma near the
Mekong River. This line taps the rich tin, silver, and
antimony deposits of south Yunnan and Kwangsi,
while rich iron and coal fields are found right along
the whole line. Gold, copper, mercury, and lead are
also found in many places. As regards agricultural
products, rice and groundnuts are found in great abundance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
also camphor, cassia, sugar, tobacco, and various
kinds of fruits.</p>

<h4>g. The Canton-Yamchow Line</h4>

<p>This line is about 400 miles long measuring from the
west end of the Sikiang bridge. Starting from Canton
it runs on the tracks of line (f) as far as the farther
side of the bridge over the West River. Thence it
branches off to the southwest to Hoiping and Yanping,
and by way of Yeungchun to Kochow and Fachow.
At Fachow, a branch line of 100 miles should be projected
to Suikai, Luichow and Haian on the Hainan
Straits where, by means of a ferry, it connects with
Hainan Island. The main line continues from Fachow
westward to Sheshing, Limchow, Yamchow and ends
on the Annam border at Tunghing, where it may connect
with a French line to Haiphong. This line is
entirely within the Kwangtung province. It passes
through a very populous and productive country. Coal
and iron are found along the whole line, while gold and
antimony, in some parts. Agricultural products, as
sugar, silk, camphor, ramie, indigo, groundnuts, and
various kinds of fruits are raised here.</p>

<p>The total length of this system as outlined above is
about 6,700 miles. In addition there will be two connecting
lines between Chengtu and Chungking; another
from east of Tsunyi on line (b) southward to Wengan
on line (c); another from Pingyueh on line (c) to
Tuyun on line (d); another from the border of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Kweichow on line (d) through Nantan and Noti to
Tunglan on line (e), thence through Szecheng to Poseh
on line (f). These connecting lines total about 600
miles. So the grand total will be about 7,300 miles.</p>

<p>This system will be intersected by three lines. First,
the existing French line from Laokay to Yunnanfu
with a projected line from Yunnanfu to Chungking
crosses line (f) at Amichow, line (e) at Weining, line
(d) at Suifu, line (c) at Luchow, and meets lines (a)
and (b) at Chungking. Second, the projected British
line from Shasi to Sinyi crosses line (a) at Shenchow,
line (b) at Chenyuen, line (c) at Pingyueh, line (d)
at Kweiyang and a branch of line (e) at a point west
of Yungning. Third, the projected American line
from Chuchow to Yamchow crosses line (a) at Yungchow,
line (b) at Chuanchow, line (c) at Kweilin, line
(d) at Liuchow, line (e) at Tsienkiang, line (f) at
Nanning, and meets line (g) at Yamchow. Thus, if
this system and the three projected French, British,
and American lines are completed, Southwestern China
would be well provided with railway communications.</p>

<p>All these lines will run through the length and
breadth of a vast mineral country, in which most of
the essential and valuable metals of the world are found.
There is no place in the world which possesses as here
so many varieties of rare metals, such as wolfram,
tin, antimony, silver, gold, and platinum and at the
same time so richly provided with the common but
essential metals, such as copper, lead, and iron.
Furthermore, almost every district in this region is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
abundantly provided with coal, so much so that there
is a common saying: "Mu mei pu lih cheng," that
is, "Nobody would build a city where there is no coal
underneath." The idea was that in case of a siege those
within the city might obtain fuel from under the
ground. In Szechwan, petroleum and natural gas are
also found in abundance.</p>

<p>Thus, we see that this Southwestern Railway System
for the development of mineral resources in the mountainous
regions of Southwestern China is just as important
as the Northwestern Railway System is for
the development of agricultural resources in the vast
prairies of Mongolia and Turkestan. These railway
systems are a necessity to the Chinese people and a
very profitable undertaking to foreign capitalists.
They are of about equal length, viz.&mdash;about 7,000 miles.
The cost per mile of the Southwestern System will be
at least twice that of the Northwestern System, but
the remuneration from the development of mineral
resources will be many times that from the development
of agricultural resources.</p>

<h3>PART IV<br />

<span class="subhead">The Construction of Coast Ports and
Fishing Harbors</span></h3>

<p>After planning the three world ports on the coast
of China, it is time for me to go on and deal with the
development of second-and third-class seaports and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
fishing harbors along the whole coast in order to complete
a system of seaports for China. Recently, my
projected plan of the Great Northern Port was so
enthusiastically received by the people of Chili Province
that the Provincial Assembly has approved the
project and decided to carry it out at once as a provincial
undertaking. For this object, a loan of
$40,000,000 has been voted. This is an encouraging
sign and doubtless the other projects will be taken up
sooner or later by either the provinces or the Central
Government, when the people begin to realize their
necessity. I propose that four second-class seaports
and nine third-class seaports and numerous fishing
harbors should be constructed.</p>

<p>The four second-class seaports will be arranged so as
to be placed in the following manner: one on the
extreme north, one on the extreme south, and the other
two midway between the three great world ports.</p>

<p>I shall deal with them according to the order of their
future importance as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. Yingkow.</li>
<li>b. Haichow.</li>
<li>c. Foochow.</li>
<li>d. Yamchow.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. Yingkow</h4>

<p>Yingkow is situated at the head of the Liaotung
Gulf and was once the only seaport of Manchuria.
Since the improvement of Talien as a seaport, the trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
of Yingkow has dwindled and lost half of its former
business. As a seaport, Yingkow has two disadvantages,
first, the shallowness of its approach from the
sea and second, the blocking up by ice for several
months in winter. Its only advantages over Talien is
that it is situated at the mouth of the Liaoho and has
inland water communication throughout the Liao
valley in south Manchuria. The half of the former
trade that it still holds at present against Talien is
entirely due to the inland water facility. To make
Yingkow outmatch Talien again in the future and
become first in importance after the three great world
ports, we must improve its inland water communication,
as well as deepen its approach from the sea. In
regard to the improvement of the approach work
similar to the improvement of the Canton Approach
should be adopted. Besides the construction of a deep
channel, about twenty feet in depth, reclamation work
should be carried out at the same time. For, the shallow
and extensive swamp at the head of the Liaotung
Gulf could be turned into rice-producing land from
which great profit could be derived. Regarding the
inland water communication, not only the water system
in the Liao valley but also the Sungari and the Amur
Systems have to be improved. The most important
work is the construction of a canal to connect these
systems and this I shall now discuss in the next paragraph.</p>

<p>The Liaoho-Sungari Canal is the most important
factor in the future prosperity of Yingkow. It is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
this canal only that this port can be made the most
important of the second-class seaports in China and
further the vast forest lands, the virgin soil and the
rich mineral resources of North Manchuria can be
connected by water communication with Yingkow.
So this canal is all important for Yingkow, without
which Yingkow as a seaport could at most hold her
present position, a town of 60,000 to 70,000 inhabitants
and an annual trade of $30,000,000 to $40,000,000
only and could never gain a place as the first of
the second-class seaports in China. This canal can be
cut either south of Hwaiteh in a line parallel to the
South Manchurian Railway between Fan Kia Tun and
Sze Tung Shan, a distance of less than ten miles, or
north of Hwaiteh in a line between Tsing-shan-pao and
Kaw-shan-tun, a distance of about fifteen miles. In
the former case the canal is shorter but it makes the
waterway as a whole longer, while in the latter case, the
canal is about twice as long but it makes the waterway
as a whole shorter between the two systems. In either
line, there are no impassable physical obstacles. Both
lines are on the plain but the elevation of the one may
be higher than that of the other, which is the only
factor that will determine the choice between the two.
If this canal is constructed, then the rich provinces of
Kirin and Heilungkiang and a portion of Outer Mongolia
will be brought within direct water communication
with China Proper. At present, all water traffic
has to go by way of the Russian Lower Amur, then
round a great detour of the Japan Sea before reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
China Proper. This canal will not only be a great
necessity to Yingkow as a seaport, but will also have
a great bearing on the whole Chinese nation economically
and politically. With the Liaoho-Sungari Canal
completed Yingkow will be the grand terminus of the
inland waterway system of all Manchuria and Northeastern
Mongolia; and with the approach from the sea
deepened it will also be a seaport next in importance
only to the three first-class world ports.</p>

<h4>b. Haichow</h4>

<p>Haichow is situated on the eastern edge of the central
plain of China. This plain is one of the most
extensive and fertile areas on earth. As a seaport,
Haichow is midway between the two great world ports
along the coast line, namely the Great Northern and the
Great Eastern Ports. It has been made as the terminus
of the Hailan railway, the trunk line of central China
from east to west. Haichow also possesses the facility
of inland water communication. If the Grand Canal
and the other waterway systems are improved, it will
be connected with the Hoangho Valley in North China,
the Yangtze Valley in Central China, and the Sikiang
Valley in South China. Its deep sea approach is comparatively
good, being the only spot along the 250
miles of the North Kiangsu coast that could be reached
by ocean steamers to within a few miles of the shore.
To make Haichow a seaport for 20 feet draught vessels,
the approach has to be dredged for many miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
from the mouth of the river before the four fathom
line could be reached. Although possessing better advantages
than Yingkow, in being ice free, Haichow, as
a second-class seaport, has to be content to take a
second place after Yingkow, because she does not have
as vast a hinterland as Yingkow, nor such a monopolistic
position in regard to inland water communication.</p>

<h4>c. Foochow</h4>

<p>Foochow, the capital of Fukien Province, ranks
third among our second-class seaports. Foochow is
already a very large city, its inhabitants being nearly a
million. It is situated at the lower reach of the Min
River, about 30 miles from the sea. The hinterland of
this port is confined to the Min Valley with an area of
about 30,000 square miles. The territory beyond this
valley will be commanded by other coast or river ports,
so the area commanded by this port is much smaller
than that by Haichow. Consequently, it could be
given only the third place in the category of second-class
seaports. The Foochow approach from the Outer
Bar to Kinpei Entrance is very shallow. After this
Entrance is passed, the river is confined on both sides
by high hills and becomes narrow and deep right up
to Pagoda Anchorage.</p>

<p>I propose that a new port should be constructed at
the lower part of Nantai Island. For here land is
cheap and there will be plenty of room for modern improvement.
A locked basin for shipping could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
constructed at the lower point of Nantai Island, just
above Pagoda Anchorage. The left branch of the Min
River above Foochow City should be blocked up so as
to concentrate the current to flush the harbor at the
south side of Nantai. The blocked-up channel on the
north side of that island should be left to be reclaimed
by natural process or may be used as a tidal basin to
flush the channel below Pagoda Anchorage, if it is
found necessary. The upper Min River must be improved
as far as possible for inland water traffic. Its
lower reach from Pagoda Anchorage to the sea must
be trained and regulated to secure a through channel
of 30 feet or more to the open sea. Thus Foochow
could also be made a calling port for ocean liners that
ply between the world ports.</p>

<h4>d. Yamchow</h4>

<p>Yamchow is situated at the head of Tongking Gulf
in the extreme south of the China Coast. This city is
about 400 miles west of Canton&mdash;the Great Southern
Port. All the districts lying west of Yamchow will
find their way to the sea by this port 400 miles shorter
than by Canton. As sea transportation is commonly
known to be twenty times cheaper than rail transportation,
the shortening of a distance of 400 miles to the
sea means a great deal economically to the provinces of
Szechuan, Yunnan, Kweichow, and a part of Kwangsi.
Although Nanning, an inland water port, lying northwest
of Yamchow, is much nearer to the hinterland
than Yamchow, yet it could not serve this hinterland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
as a seaport. So all the direct import and export trade
will find Yamchow the cheapest shipping stage.</p>

<p>To improve Yamchow as a seaport the Lungmen
River should be regulated in order to secure a deep
channel to the city, and the estuary should be deepened
by dredging and training to provide a good approach
to the port. This port has been selected as the terminus
of the Chuchow Yamchow Railway (Chu-Kin line)
which will run from Hunan through Kwangsi into
Kwangtung. Although the hinterland of this port is
much larger than that of Foochow, yet I still rank it
after that city because the area commanded by it is also
commanded by Canton, the southern world port, and
by Nanning, the river port, and so all internal as well
as indirect import and export trade must go to the
other two ports. It is only the direct foreign trade
that will use Yamchow. Thus, in spite of its extensive
hinterland it is very improbable that it could outmatch
Foochow in the future as a second-class port.</p>

<p>Besides the three great world ports, and the four
second-class ports, I propose to construct nine third-class
ports along the China coast, from north to south,
as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. Hulutao.</li>
<li>b. Hoangho Port.</li>
<li>c. Chefoo.</li>
<li>d. Ningpo.</li>
<li>e. Wenchow.</li>
<li>f. Amoy.</li>
<li>g. Swatow.</li>
<li>h. Tienpak.</li>
<li>i. Hoihou.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. Hulutao</h4>

<p>Hulutao is an ice-free and deep-water port, situated
on the west side of the head of Liaotung Gulf, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
60 miles from Yingkow. As a winter port for Manchuria,
it is in a more advantageous position than Talien
for it is about 200 miles shorter by rail to the sea than
the latter and is on the edge of a rich coal field.
When this coal field and the surrounding mineral
resources are developed, Hulutao will become the
first of the third-class ports and a good outlet for
Jehol and Eastern Mongolia. This port may be projected
as an alternative to Yingkow, as the sole port of
Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia, if a canal could be
constructed to connect it with the Liaoho. It is only by
inland water communication that Yingkow could be
made the important port of Manchuria in the future
and it will be the same in the case of Hulutao. So if
inland water communication could be secured for Hulutao
it will entirely displace Yingkow. If it is found
to be economically cheaper in the long run to construct
a Hulutao-Liaoho Canal than to construct a deep harbor
at Yingkow, the Hulutao harbor will have to be
placed on the northwest side of the peninsula instead
of on the southwest as at present projected. For the
present site has not enough room for anchorage without
building an extensive breakwater into the deep sea,
which will be a very expensive work. Furthermore,
there would not be room enough for city planning on
the narrow peninsula, whereas on the other side, the
city could be built on the mainland with unlimited space
for its development.</p>

<p>I suggest that a sea wall be built from the northern
point of Lienshanwan to the northern point of Hulutao<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
to close up the Lienshan Bay and make it into a closed
harbor, and an entrance be opened in the neck of Hulutao
to the south side where deep water is found. This
closed harbor will be over 10 square miles in extent
but only some parts need to be dredged to the required
depth at present. On the north side of the harbor,
another entrance into the neighboring bay should be
left open between the sea wall and the shore, and
another breakwater should be built across the next bay.
From there, a canal should be constructed either by cutting
into the shore or by building a wall parallel with
the coast line until it reaches the lowland from where
a canal should be cut to connect with the Liaoho. If a
canal is thus constructed for Hulutao, then it will at
once take the place of Yingkow and become the first
of the second-class ports.</p>

<h4>b. The Hoangho Port</h4>

<p>The Hoangho Port will be situated at the estuary of
the Hoangho on the southern side of the Gulf of Pechihli,
about 80 miles from our Great Northern Port.
When the Hoangho regulation is completed its estuary
will be approachable by ocean steamers, and a seaport
will naturally spring up there. As it commands a considerable
part of the northern plain in the provinces
of Shantung, Chili, and Honan and possesses the facility
of inland water communication, this port is bound
to become an important third-class port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<h4>c. Chefoo</h4>

<p>Chefoo is an old treaty port situated on the northern
side of the Shantung Peninsula. Once it was the only
ice-free port in the whole of North China. Since the
development of Talien in the north and the development
of Tsingtau in the south its trade has dwindled considerably.
As a seaport, it will undoubtedly hold its own
when the railroads in the Shantung Peninsula are developed,
and the artificial harbor is completed.</p>

<h4>d. Ningpo</h4>

<p>Ningpo is also an old treaty port, situated on a small
river, the Yungkiang, in the eastern part of Chekiang
province. It has a good approach, deep water reaching
right up to the estuary of the river. The harbor
can be easily improved by simply training and straightening
two bends along its course up to the city. Ningpo
commands a very small but rich hinterland. Its people
are very enterprising, and are famed for their workmanship
and handicrafts second only to those of Canton.
Thus Ningpo is bound to become a manufacturing
city when China is industrially developed. But owing
to the proximity of the Great Eastern Port, Ningpo
will not likely have much import and export trade
directly with foreign countries. Most of its trade will
be carried on with the Great Eastern Port. So a moderate
harbor for local and coast-wise traffic will be
quite sufficient for Ningpo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<h4>e. Wenchow</h4>

<p>Wenchow is situated near the mouth of the Wukiang
in south Chekiang. This seaport has a wider hinterland
than Ningpo, its surrounding districts being very
productive. If railroads are developed it will undoubtedly
command considerable local trade. At present the
harbor is very shallow, unapproachable by even moderate-sized
coastal steamers. I suggest that a new harbor
at Panshiwei, north of Wenchow Island be constructed.
For this purpose, a dike should be built between the
northern bank and the head of Wenchow Island to
block up the river entirely on the northern side of that
island leaving only a lock entrance. The Wukiang
should be led through the channel on the south side of
the island for the purpose of reclaiming the vast expanse
of the near-by shallows as well as for draining
the upper stream. The approach from the southern
side of Hutau Island to the port should be dredged.
On the right side of the approach, a wall should be
built in the shallow between Wenchow Island and Miau
Island and in the shallows between Miau Island and
Sanpam Island so as to form a continuous wall to prevent
the silt of Wukiang from entering into the
approach. Thus a permanent deep channel will be
secured for the new port of Wenchow.</p>

<h4>f. Amoy</h4>

<p>Amoy, an old treaty port, is situated on the island of
Siming. It has a great, deep, and fine harbor, commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
a considerable hinterland in southern Fukien
and Kiangsi, very rich in coal and iron deposits. This
port carries on a busy trade with the Malay Archipelago
and the Southeastern Asian Peninsula. Most of the
Chinese residents in the southern islands, Annam,
Burma, Siam, and the Malay States are from the
neighborhood of Amoy. So the passenger traffic between
Amoy and the southern colonies is very great.
If railways are developed to tap the rich iron and coal
fields in the hinterland, Amoy is bound to develop into
a much larger seaport than it is at present. I suggest
that a modern port be constructed on the west side of
the harbor to act as an outlet for the rich mineral fields
of southern Fukien and Kiangsi. This port should be
equipped with modern plants in order to connect land
and sea transportation.</p>

<h4>g. Swatow</h4>

<p>Swatow is situated at the mouth of the Hankiang at
the extreme east of Kwangtung. In relation to emigration,
Swatow is much similar to Amoy, for it also
supplies a great number of colonists to southeastern
Asia and the Malay Archipelago. So its passenger traffic
with the south is just as busy as Amoy. As a seaport
Swatow is far inferior to Amoy, on account of its
shallow approach. But in regard to inland water communication,
Swatow is in a better position as the Hankiang
is navigable for many hundreds of miles inland
by shallow crafts. The country around Swatow is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
very productive agriculturally, being second only to
the Canton Delta along the Southern seaboard. In the
upper reaches of the Hankiang there are very rich iron
and coal deposits. The approach to the port of Swatow
can be improved easily by a little training and dredging,
thus making it a fine local port.</p>

<h4>h. Tienpak</h4>

<p>Tienpak is situated at a point in the coast of Kwangtung
province between the estuary of the West River
and the island of Hainan. Its surrounding districts
are rich in agricultural products and mineral deposits.
So a shipping port in this part is quite necessary.
Tienpak can be made into a fine harbor by entirely
walling in the bay from its west side and by opening a
new entrance into the deep water in the neck of the peninsula
southeast of the bay. Thus a good approach
could be secured. The harbor is very wide but only a
part need be dredged for large vessels and the rest of
the space could be used by fishing boats and other
shallow crafts.</p>

<h4>i. Hoihou</h4>

<p>Hoihou is situated on the north side of Hainan
Island on the strait of the same name, opposite Haian
on the Luichow Peninsula. Hoihou is a treaty port,
similar to Amoy and Swatow, supplying a great number
of colonists to the south; Hainan is a very rich but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
undeveloped island. Only the land along the coast is
cultivated, the central part being still covered by thick
forests and inhabited by aborigines, and it is very rich
in mineral deposits. When the whole island is fully
developed, the port of Hoihou will be a busy harbor
for export and import traffic. The harbor of Hoihou
is very shallow, and so even small vessels have to
anchor miles away in the roadstead outside. This is
very inconvenient for passengers and cargoes, so the
improvement of the Hoihou harbor is a necessity.
Furthermore this harbor will be the ferry point between
this island and the mainland for railway traffic when
the railway systems of the mainland and the island are
completed.</p>

<h4>Fishing Harbors</h4>

<p>As regards fishing harbors all our first-, second-, and
third-class ports must also furnish facilities and accommodations
for fishery. Thus all of these, i.e., three
first-class ports, four second-class ports, and nine third-class
ports, will be fishing harbors as well. But besides
these sixteen ports there is still room and need to
construct more fishing harbors along the coast of China.
I propose, therefore, that five fishing harbors be constructed
along the northern coast, that is, along the
coast of Fengtien, Chihli, and Shantung, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Antung, on Yalu River, on the border of
Korea.</p>

<p>(2) Haiyangtao, on the Yalu Bay, south of Liaotung
Peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
(3) Chinwangtao, on the coast of Chihli, between
the Liaotung and Pechihli gulfs, the present ice-free
port of Chihli province.</p>

<p>(4) Lungkau, on the northwestern side of Shantung
Peninsula.</p>

<p>(5) Shitauwan, at the southeastern point of the
Shantung Peninsula.</p>

<p>Six fishing harbors should be constructed along the
eastern coast, that is, along the coasts of Kiangsu, Chekiang,
and Fukien, as follows:</p>

<p>(6) Shinyangkang, on the eastern coast of
Kiangsu, south of the old mouth of the Hoangho.</p>

<p>(7) Luszekang, at the northern point of the
Yangtze Estuary.</p>

<p>(8) Changtukang, in the midst of Chusan Archipelago.</p>

<p>(9) Shipu, north of Sammen Bay, east of Chekiang.</p>

<p>(10) Funing, between Foochow and Wenchow,
east of Fukien.</p>

<p>(11) Meichow Harbor, north of Meichow Island,
between Foochow and Amoy.</p>

<p>Four fishing harbors should be constructed on the
southern coast, that is, along the seaboard of
Kwangtung and Hainan Island, as follows.</p>

<p>(12) Sanmei, on the eastern coast of Kwangtung,
between Hongkong and Swatow.</p>

<p>(13) Sikiang Mouth. This harbor should be on
the northern side of Wangkum Island. When the
Sikiang Mouth is regulated, the Wangkum Island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
will be connected with the mainland by a sea wall, so
a good harbor site could thus be provided.</p>

<p>(14) Haian, situated at the end of the Luichow
Peninsula opposite to Hoihou, on the other side of
Hainan Strait.</p>

<p>(15) Yulinkang a fine natural harbor at the extreme
south of the Hainan Island.</p>

<p>These fifteen fishing harbors with the greater ports,
numbering 31 in all, will link up the whole coast line of
China from Antung, on the Korean border to Yamchow,
near the Annam border, providing, on an average,
a port for every 100 miles of coast line. This
completes my project of seaports and fishing harbors
for China.</p>

<p>At first sight objections might be raised that too
many seaports and fishing harbors are provided for
one country. But I must remind my readers that this
one country, China, is as big as Europe and has a
population larger than that of Europe. If we take
a similar length of the coast line of western Europe
we would see that there are many more ports
in Europe than in China. Besides, the coast line of
Europe is many times longer than that of China, and
in every hundred miles of the European coast line there
are more than one considerable-sized port. Take Holland,
for instance. Its whole area is not larger than
the hinterland of Swatow, one of our third-class seaports,
yet it possesses two first-class ports, Amsterdam
and Rotterdam, and numerous small fishing ports. Let
us also compare our country with the United States of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
America in regard to seaports. America has only one
fourth the population of China yet the number of ports
on her Atlantic coast alone is many times more than the
number provided in my plan. Thus, this number of
ports for China for the future is but a bare necessity.
And I have considered only those that will pay from the
beginning so as to adhere strictly to the principle of
remuneration that was laid down at the outset of my
first program. See Map XVI.</p>

<h3>PART V<br />

<span class="subhead">The Establishment of Shipbuilding Yards</span></h3>

<p>When China is well developed according to my programs,
the possession of an oversea mercantile fleet, of
ships for coastal and inland water transportation, and
of a large fishing fleet will be an urgent necessity.
Before the outbreak of the late World War, the world's
seagoing tonnage was 45,000,000 tons. If China is
equally developed industrially, according to the proportion
of her population, she would need at least 10,000,000
tons of oversea and coastal shipping for her
transportation service. The building of this tonnage
must be a part of our industrial development scheme;
for cheap materials and labor can be obtained in the
country, and so we could build ships for ourselves much
cheaper than any foreign country could do for us.
And besides the building of a seagoing fleet, we have to
build our inland water crafts and fishing fleets. Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
shipping yards could not do this service for us on
account of the impracticability of transporting such
numerous small crafts across the ocean. Thus, in any
case, China has to put up her own yards to build her
inland water crafts and fishing fleets. So the establishment
of ship building yards is a necessary as well as
a profitable undertaking from the beginning. The shipping
yards should be established at such river and
coastal ports that have the facility of supplying materials
and labor. All the yards should be under one
central management. Large capital should be invested
in the project so as to procure a yearly output of
2,000,000 tons of various kinds of vessels.</p>

<p>All types of vessels should be standardized both in
design and equipment. The old and wasteful types of
inland water crafts and fishing boats should be replaced
by modern efficient designs. The inland water crafts
should be designed on the basis of certain standard
draughts such as the 2-foot, 5-foot, and 10-foot classes.
The fishing trawlers should be standardized into the
one-day, the five-day, and the ten-day service class. The
coastal transports should be standardized into the
2,000-, the 4,000-, and the 6,000-ton class, and for
oversea transports we should have standardized ships
of 12,000-, 24,000-, and 36,000-ton classes. Thus, the
many thousands of inland water crafts and fishing
junks that now ply the rivers, lakes, and coasts of
China may be displaced by new and cheaper crafts of a
few standard types which could perform better services
at less expense.</p>

<h2><a name="PROGRAM_IV" id="PROGRAM_IV">PROGRAM IV.</a></h2>

<p>In my first and third programs, I have described my
plans for the Northwestern Railway System and the
Southwestern Railway System. The former is for the
purpose of relieving the congestion of population in the
coast districts and the Yangtze Valley by opening up
for colonization the vast unpopulated territory in
Mongolia and Sinkiang, as well as of developing the
Great Northern Port. The latter is for the purpose of
exploiting the mineral resources of Southwestern
China, as well as of developing the Great Southern
Port&mdash;Canton. More railroads will be needed for the
adequate development of the whole country. So in this
fourth program, I shall deal entirely with railroads
which will complete the 100,000 miles proposed in my
introductory part of this International Development
Scheme. The program will be as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><blockquote class="rmn">
<p><span class="rmn-i">I.</span> The Central Railway System.</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<h3>PART I<br />

<span class="subhead">The Central Railway System</span></h3>

<p>This will be the most important railway system in
China. The area which it serves comprises all of China
Proper north of the Yangtze and a part of Mongolia
and Sinkiang. The economic nature of this vast region
is that the southeastern part is densely populated while
the northwestern part is thinly populated, and that the
southeastern part possesses great mineral wealth while
the northwestern part possesses great potential agricultural
resources. So every line of this system will surely
pay as the Peking-Mukden line has proved.</p>

<p>With the Great Eastern Port and the Great Northern
Port as termini of this system of railroads, I propose
that, besides the existing and projected lines in this
region, the following be constructed, all of which shall
constitute the Central Railway System.</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai line.</li>
<li>b. The Great Eastern Port-Urga line.</li>

<li>e. The Nanking-Hankow line.</li>
<li>f. The Sian-Tatung line.</li>
<li>g. The Sian-Ninghsia line.</li>

<li>w. The Coast line.</li>
<li>x. The Hwoshan-Kashing line.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai Line</h4>

<p>This line begins at the Great Eastern Port on the
seaboard, and runs in a northwesterly direction to
Tarbogotai on the Russian frontier, covering a distance
of about 3,000 miles. If Shanghai be the Great
Eastern Port, the Shanghai-Nanking Railway will
form its first section. But if Chapu be chosen, then
this line should skirt the Taihu Lake on the southwest
through the cities of Huchow, Changhing, and Liyang
to Nanking, then crossing the Yangtze at a point south
of Nanking, to Chiantsiao and Tingyuen. Thence, the
line turns westward to Showchow and Yingshang, and
enters Honan province at Sintsai. After crossing the
Peking-Hankow line at Kioshan, and passing Piyang,
Tanghsien, and Tengchow, it turns northwestward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Sichwan and Kingtsekwan, and enters the province of
Shensi. Ascending the Tan Kiang Valley, it passes
through Lungkucha and Shangchow, and crosses the
Tsinling Pass to Lantien and Sian, the capital of
Shensi, formerly the capital of China. From Sian, it
goes westward, following the valley of the Weiho. It
passes through Chowchih, Meihsien, and Paoki and
enters the province of Kansu at Sancha, thence proceeding
to Tsinchow, Kungchang, Titao, and Lanchow, the
capital of Kansu. From Lanchow it follows the old
highway which leads into Liangchow, Kanchow,
Suchow, Yumen, and Ansichow. Thence it crosses the
desert in a northwesterly direction to Hami, where it
turns westward to Turfan. At Turfan this line meets
the Northwestern Railway System and runs on the
latter's track to Urumochi and Manass where it leaves
that track and proceeds northwesterly to Tarbogotai on
the frontier, crossing the Shair Mountain on the way.
This line runs from one end of the country to the other
encountering in its entire length of 3,000 miles only
four mountain passes, all of which are not impassable
for they have been used from time immemorial, as
trade highways of Asia.</p>

<h4>b. The Great Eastern Port-Urga Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from the Great Eastern Port and uses
the same track as line (a) as far as Tingyuen, the
second city after crossing the Yangtze River at Nanking.
From Tingyuen, its own track begins and the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
proceeds in a northwesterly direction to Hwaiyuan, on
the Hwai River, thence to Mongcheng, Kwoyang, and
Pochow. Turning more northward, it crosses the
Anhwei border into Honan, and passing through
Kweiteh it crosses the Honan border into Shantung.
After passing through Tsaohsien, Tingtao, and Tsaochow,
it crosses the Hoangho and enters Chihli province.
Passing through Kaichow it re-enters Honan to
Changteh, thence it follows the Tsingchangho valley,
in a northwesterly direction, across the Honan border
into Shansi. Here the line enters the northeastern
corner of the vast iron and coal field of Shansi. After
entering Shansi, the line follows the river valley to
Liaochow and Yicheng, and crosses the watershed into
the Tungkwoshui Valley to Yutse and Taiyuan. From
Taiyuan, it proceeds northwestward through another
rich iron and coal field of Shansi to Kolan. Thence, it
turns westward to Poate, where it crosses the Hoangho
to Fuku, in the northeastern corner of Shensi. From
Fuku, the line proceeds northward, cuts through the
Great Wall into the Suiyuan District and crosses the
Hoangho to Saratsi. From Saratsi, the line runs in a
northwesterly direction across the vast prairie to Junction
A of the Northwestern Trunk Line, where it joins
the common track of the Dolon Nor-Urga line to Urga.
This line runs from a thickly populated country at one
end in Central China to the vast thinly populated
but fertile regions of Central Mongolia, having a
distance of about 1,300 miles from Tingyuen to
Junction A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h4>c. The Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai Line</h4>

<p>Starting from the Great Eastern Port, this line follows
line (a) as far as Tingyuen, and line (b) as far
as Pochow. At Pochow, it branches off on its own track
and proceeds westward across the border to Luye, in
Honan. Thence it turns northwestward to Taikang,
Tungsu, and Chungmow where it meets the Hailan line
and runs in the same direction with it to Chengchow,
Jungyang, and Szeshui. From Szeshui it crosses the
Hoangho to Wenhsien, thence to Hwaiking and over
the Honan border into Shansi. It now passes through
Yangcheng, Chinshui, and Fowshan to Pingyang
where it crosses the Fen River and proceeds to Puhsien
and Taning, then westward to the border where it
crosses the Hoangho into Shensi. Thence it proceeds
to Yenchang, and follows the Yenshui Valley to
Yenan, Siaokwan, and Tsingpien. Then running
along the south side of the Great Wall, it enters
Kansu, and crosses the Hoangho to Ninghsia. From
Ninghsia, it proceeds northwestward across the
Alashan Mountain to Tingyuanying at the edge of
the desert. Thence it proceeds in a straight line northwestward
to Junction B of the Northwestern Railway
System, where it joins that system and runs to Uliassutai.
This part of the line passes through desert and
grassland both of which could be improved by irrigation.
The distance of this line from Pochow to
Junction B is 1,800 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<h4>d. The Nanking-Loyang Line</h4>

<p>This line runs between two former capitals of China,
passes through a very populous and fertile country, and
taps a very rich coal field at the Loyang end. It starts
from Nanking, running on the common track of lines
(a) and (b) and branches off at Hwaiyuan westward
to Taiho. After passing Taiho, it crosses the Anhwei
border into Honan. Thence it runs alongside the left
bank of the Tashaho to Chowkiakow, a large commercial
town. From Chowkiakow, it proceeds to Linying
where it crosses the Peking-Hankow line thence to
Hiangcheng and Yuchow where the rich coal field of
Honan lies. After Yuchow it crosses the Sungshan
watershed to Loyang where it meets the Hailan line
running from east to west. This line is about 300
miles from Hwaiyuan to Loyang.</p>

<h4>e. The Nanking-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This line will run alongside the left bank of the
Yangtzekiang, connecting with Kiukiang by a branch
line. It starts on the opposite side of Nanking and goes
southwest to Hochow, Wuweichow and Anking, the
capital of Anwei province. After Anking, it continues
in the same direction to Susung and Hwangmei, where
a branch should be projected to Siaochikow, thence
across the Yangtze River to Kiukiang. After Hwangmei,
the line turns westward to Kwangchi, then northwestward
to Kishui, and finally westward to Hankow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
It covers a distance of about 350 miles through a
comparatively level country.</p>

<h4>f. The Sian-Tatung Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Sian and runs northward to
Sanyuan, Yaochow, Tungkwan, Yichun, Chungpu, Foochow,
Kanchuan, and Yenan, where it meets the Great
Eastern Port-Uliassutai line. From Yenan, it turns
northeastward to Suiteh, Michih, and Kiachow on the
right bank of the Hoangho. Thence it runs along the
same bank to the junction of the Weifen River with
the Hoangho (on the opposite side), where it crosses
the Hoangho to the Weifen Valley and proceeds to
Singhsien and Kolan, there crossing the Great Eastern
Port-Urga line. From Kolan, it proceeds to Wuchai
and Yangfang, where it crosses the Great Wall to Sochow
and then Tatung there meeting the Peking-Suiyuan
line. This line is about 600 miles long. It
passes through the famous oil field in Shensi, and the
northern border of the northwestern Shansi coal field.
At Tatung, where it ends, it joins the Peking-Suiyuan
line and through the section from Tatung to Kalgan it
will connect with the future Northwestern System
which will link Kalgan and Dolon Nor together.</p>

<h4>g. The Sian-Ninghsia Line</h4>

<p>This line will start from Sian in a northwesterly
direction to Kingyanghsien, Shunhwa, and Sanshui.
After Sanshui, it crosses the Shensi border into Kansu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
at Chengning and then turns west to Ningchow. From
Ningchow, it follows the Hwan Valley along the left
bank of the river up to Kingyangfu and Hwanhsien,
where it leaves the bank and proceeds to Tsingping and
Pingyuan, where it meets the Hwan River again and
follows that valley up to the watershed. After crossing
the watershed, it proceeds to Lingchow, then across the
Hoangho to Ninghsia. This line covers a distance of
about 400 miles and passes through a rich mineral and
petroleum country.</p>

<h4>h. The Sian-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This is a very important line connecting the richest
portion of the Hoangho Valley with the richest portion
of the central section of the Yangtze Valley. It starts
from Sian on the track of line (a), crosses the Tsingling
and descends the Tankiang Valley as far as
Sichwan. At this point, it branches off southward
across the border into Hupeh, and following the left
bank of the Han River, passes Laohokow to Fencheng,
opposite Siangyang. After Fencheng, it follows continuously
the same bank of the Han River to Anlu,
thence proceeding in a direct line southeastward to
Hanchwan and Hankow. This line is about 300 miles
long.</p>

<h4>i. The Sian-Chungking Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Sian almost directly southward,
crosses the Tsingling Mountain into the Han Valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
passes through Ningshen, Shihchuan, and Tzeyang,
ascends the Jenho Valley across the southern border of
Shensi into the province of Szechwan at Tachuho.
Then crossing the watershed of the Tapashan into the
Tapingho Valley, it follows that valley down to Suiting
and Chuhsien. Thence it turns to the left side of the
valley to Linshui and follows the trade road to Kiangpeh
and Chungking. The entire distance of this line is
about 450 miles through a very productive region and
rich timber land.</p>

<h4>j. The Lanchow-Chungking Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lanchow southwestward and
follows the same route as line (a) as far as Titao.
Thence, it branches off and ascends the Taoho Valley
across the Minshan watershed into the Heishui Valley
following it down to Kiaichow and Pikow. After
Pikow, it crosses the Kansu border into Szechwan and
proceeds to Chaohwa, where the Heishuiho joins the
Kialing. From Chaohwa, it follows the course of the
Kialing River down to Paoning, Shunking, Hochow,
and Chungking. The line is about 600 miles long,
running through a very productive and rich mineral
land.</p>

<h4>k. The Ansichow-Iden line</h4>

<p>This line passes through the fertile belt of land
between the Gobi Desert and the Altyntagh Mountain.
Although this strip of land is well watered by numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
mountain streams yet it is very sparsely populated,
owing to the lack of means of communication. When
this line is completed, this strip of land will be most
valuable to Chinese colonists. The line starts from
Ansichow westward to Tunhwang, and skirts the
southern edge of the Lobnor Swamp to Chochiang.
From Chochiang, it proceeds in the same direction via
Cherchen to Iden where it connects with the terminus
of the Northwestern System. With this System, it
forms a continuous and direct line from the Great
Eastern Port to Kashgar at the extreme west end of
China. This line from Ansichow to Iden is about 800
miles in length.</p>

<h4>l. The Chochiang-Koria Line</h4>

<p>This line runs across the desert alongside the lower
part of the Tarim River. The land on both sides of the
line is well watered and will be valuable for colonization
as soon as the railroad is completed. This line is about
250 miles in length and connects with the line that runs
along the northern edge of the desert. It is a short cut
between fertile lands on the two sides of the desert.</p>

<h4>m. The Great Northern Port-Hami Line</h4>

<p>This line runs from the Great Northern Port in a
northwesterly direction by way of Paoti and Siangho
to Peking. From Peking it runs on the same track
with the Peking-Kalgan Railway to Kalgan, where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
ascends the Mongolian Plateau. Then it follows the
caravan road northwestward to Chintai, Bolutai, Sessy,
and Tolibulyk. From Tolibulyk, it takes a straight line
westward crossing the prairie and desert of both the
Inner and Outer Mongolia to Hami where it connects
with the Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai line which
runs almost directly west to Urumochi, the capital of
Sinkiang. Thus, it will be the direct line from
Urumochi to Peking and the Great Northern Port.
This line is about 1,500 miles in length, the greater part
of which will run through arable land and so when it
is completed it will form one of the most valuable railways
for colonization.</p>

<h4>n. The Great Northern Port-Sian Line</h4>

<p>This line will run westward from the Great Northern
Port to Tientsin. From here it runs southwestward to
Hokien, passing through Tsinghai and Tachen. From
Hokien, it runs more westerly to Shentseh, Wuki, and
Chengting where it joins the Chengtai line as well as
crosses the Kinhan line. From Chengting it takes the
same road as the narrow gauge Chengtai line which
has to be reconstructed into standard gauge so as to
facilitate through trains to Taiyuan and farther on.
From Taiyuan it runs southwestward to Kiaocheng,
Wenshui, Fenchow, Sichow, and Taning. After Taning
it turns westward and crossing the Hoangho, it
turns southwestward to Yichwan, Lochwan, and
Chungpu where it joins the Sian-Tatung line and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
runs on the same tracks to Sian. Its length is about
700 miles over very rich and extensive iron, coal, and
petroleum fields, as well as productive agricultural
lands.</p>

<h4>o. The Great Northern Port-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from the Great Northern Port skirting
the coast to Petang, Taku, and Chikow, thence to
Yenshan and crosses the Chili border into Shantung
at Loling. From Loling, it goes to Tehping, Linyi and
Yucheng where it crosses the Tientsin-Pukow line,
proceeds to Tungchang and Fanhsien, and then crosses
the Hoangho to Tsaochow. After Tsaochow it passes
the Shantung border into Honan, crossing the Hailan
line to Suichow. From Suichow it proceeds to Taikang
where it crosses line (c), then to Chenchow and Chowkiakow
where it crosses line (d) and thence to Siangcheng,
Sintsai, Kwangchow, and Kwangshan. After
Kwangshan it crosses the boundary mountain into
Hupeh, passing through Hwangan to Hankow. This
line is about 700 miles long, running from the Great
Northern Port to the commercial center of central
China.</p>

<h4>p. The Hoangho Port-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from the Hoangho Port in a southwesterly
direction to Pohsing, Sincheng, and Changshan,
then across the Kiauchow-Tsinan line to Poshan.
Thence it ascends the watershed into the Wen Valley
to Taian where it crosses the Tientsin-Pukow line to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Ningyang and Tsining. From Tsining it proceeds in a
straight line southwestward to Pochow in Anhwei,
and Sintsai in Honan. At Sintsai it joins the Great
Northern Port-Hankow line to Hankow. The distance
of this line from the Hoangho Port to Sintsai is about
400 miles.</p>

<h4>q. The Chefoo-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts at Chefoo on the northern side of
the Shantung Peninsula and crosses that Peninsula to
Tsimo, on the southern side, via Laiyang and Kinkiakow.
From Tsimo it proceeds southwestward across
the shallow mud flat at the head of Kiauchow Bay in a
straight line to Chucheng. After Chucheng it crosses
the watershed into the Shuho Valley to Chuchow and
Ichow, then proceeds to Hsuchow where it meets the
Tientsin-Pukow line and the Hailan line. From
Hsuchow it runs on the same track with the Tientsin-Pukow
line as far as Suchow in Anhwei, then branches
off to Mongcheng and Yinchow, and crosses the border
into Honan at Kwangchow, where it meets the Great
Northern Port-Hankow line and proceeds together to
Hankow. This line from Chefoo to Kwangchow is
about 550 miles in length.</p>

<h4>r. The Haichow-Tsinan Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Haichow following the Linhung
River to Kwantunpu, then turns westward to Ichow.
From Ichow it turns first northward then northwestward,
passing by Mongyin and Sintai to Tai-an. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Tai-an it joins the Tsinpu line and proceeds in the same
track to Tsinan. This line covers a distance, from
Haichow to Tai-an, of about 110 miles, tapping the
coal and iron fields of southern Shantung.</p>

<h4>s. The Haichow-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts at Haichow in a southwesterly direction,
goes to Shuyang and Sutsien, probably in the
same route as the projected Hailan line. From Sutsien
it proceeds to Szechow and Hwaiyuan, where it crosses
the Great Eastern Port Urga and Uliassutai lines.
After Hwaiyuan it goes to Showchow and Chenyangkwan,
thence continuing in the same direction across
the southeastern corner of Honan and the boundary
mountain into Hupeh, proceeds to Macheng and Hankow,
covering a distance of about 400 miles.</p>

<h4>t. The Haichow-Nanking Line</h4>

<p>This line goes from Haichow southward to Antung
then inclining a little south to Hwaian. After Hwaian
it crosses the Paoying Lake (which will be reclaimed
according to the regulation of the Hwaiho in Part IV,
Program II) to Tienchang and Luho, thence to Nanking.
Distance, about 180 miles.</p>

<h4>u. The Sinyangkang-Hankow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Sinyangkang to Yencheng, then
crossing the Tasung Lake (which will be reclaimed) to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Hwaian. From Hwaian it turns southwestward passing
over the southeastern corner of the Hungtse Lake
(which will also be reclaimed) to Suyi, in Anhwei.
After Suyi, it crosses the Tientsin-Pukow line near
Mingkwang, to Tingyuen, where it meets lines (b) and
(c). After Tingyuen, it proceeds to Lu-an and Hwoshan,
then crosses the boundary mountain into Hupeh
passing through Lotien to Hankow, a distance of about
420 miles.</p>

<h4>v. The Luszekang-Nanking Line</h4>

<p>This line starts at Luszekang, a fishing harbor to be
constructed at the extremity of the northern point of
the Yangtze Estuary. From Luszekang it proceeds
westward to Tungchow where it turns northwestward
to Jukao, and then westward to Taichow, Yangchow,
Luho, and Nanking. This line is about 200 miles long.</p>

<h4>w. The Coast Line</h4>

<p>This line starts at the Great Northern Port, and follows
the Great Northern Port-Hankow line as far as
Chikow, where it begins its own line. Keeping along
the coast, it crosses the Chili border to the Hoangho
Port, in Shantung, then proceeds to Laichow where it
takes a straight cut away from the coast to Chaoyuan
and Chefoo, thus avoiding the projected Chefoo-Weihsien
line. From Chefoo it proceeds southeastward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
through Ninghai to Wenteng, where one branch
runs to Jungcheng and another to Shihtao. The main
line turns southwestward to Haiyang and Kinkiakow,
where it joins the Chefoo-Hankow line, and follows
it as far as the western side of Kiauchow Bay, thence
southward to Lingshanwei. From Lingshanwei the
line proceeds southwestward along the coast to Jichao,
and crosses the Shantung border into Kiangsu, passing
Kanyu to Haichow. Thence it proceeds southeastward
to Yencheng, Tungtai, Tungchow, Haimen, and Tsungming
Island which will be connected with the mainland
by the regulation works of Yangtze embankment.
From Tsungming trains can be ferried over to Shanghai.
This line from Chikow to Tsungming is about
1,000 miles in length.</p>

<h4>x. The Hwoshan-Wuhu-Soochow-Kashing Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Hwoshan to Shucheng and
Wuwei, then across the Yangtze River to Wuhu. After
Wuhu it goes to Kaoshun, Liyang, and Ihing, then
crosses over the northern end of Taihu (which will
be reclaimed) to Soochow, where it meets the Shanghai-Nanking
line. From Soochow it turns southward
to Kashing on the Shanghai-Hangchow line. This
line runs over very populous and rich districts
of Anhwei and Kiangsu provinces, covering a
distance of about 300 miles, which will form the
greater part of the shortest line from Shanghai to
Hankow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<h3>PART II<br />

<span class="subhead">The Southeastern Railway System</span></h3>

<p>This system covers the irregular triangle which is
formed by the Coast line between the Great Eastern
and the Great Southern Ports, as the base, by the
Yangtze River from Chungking to Shanghai, as one
side, and by line (a) of the Canton-Chungking Railway
as the other side, with Chungking as the apex. This
triangle comprises the provinces of Chekiang, Fukien,
and Kiangsi, and a part respectively of Kiangsu,
Anhwei, Hupeh, Hunan, and Kwangtung. This region
is very rich in mineral and agricultural products, especially
iron and coal deposits which are found everywhere.
And the whole region is thickly populated.
So railway construction will be very remunerative.</p>

<p>With the Great Eastern Port and the Great Southern
Port and the second-and third-class ports that lie
between the two as termini of this system of railroads,
I propose that the following lines be constructed:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Great Eastern Port-Chungking Line.</li>
<li>b. The Great Eastern Port-Canton Line.</li>
<li>c. The Foochow-Chinkiang Line.</li>
<li>d. The Foochow-Wuchang Line.</li>
<li>e. The Foochow-Kweilin Line.</li>
<li>f. The Wenchow-Shenchow Line.</li>
<li>g. The Amoy-Kienchang Line.</li>
<li>h. The Amoy-Canton Line.</li>
<li>i. The Swatow-Changteh Line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></li>
<li>j. The Nanking-Siuchow Line.</li>
<li>k. The Nanking-Kaying Line.</li>
<li>l. The Coast Line between the Great Eastern and Great Southern Ports.</li>
<li>m. The Kienchang-Yuanchow Line.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Great Eastern Port-Chungking Line</h4>

<p>This line connects the commercial center of western
China&mdash;Chungking&mdash;with the Great Eastern Port in
almost a straight route south of the Yangtze River. It
starts from the Great Eastern Port and goes to Hangchow,
then through Linan, Ghanghwa, to Hweichow,
in Anhwei. From Hweichow it proceeds to Siuning
and Kimen, then crosses the border into Kiangsi and
passing Hukow reaches Kiukiang. From Kiukiang it
follows the right bank of the Yangtze, crosses the
Hupeh border to Hingkwochow and then proceeds to
Tungshan and Tsungyang, where it passes over the
border to Yochow in Hunan. From Yochow it takes
a straight line across the Tungting Lake (which will
be reclaimed) to Changteh. From Changteh it proceeds
up the Liu Shui Valley, passing through Tzeli,
and crossing the Hunan border to Hofeng, in Hupeh
and then to Shinan and Lichwan. At Shinan a branch
should be projected northeastward to Ichang, and at
Lichwan another branch should be projected northwestward
to Wanhsien, both on the left side of the Yangtze
River. After Lichwan it crosses the Hupeh border
into Szechwan, passing Shihchu to Foochow, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
passes the Wukiang and proceeds along the right side
of the Yangtze River as far as lines (a) and (b) of the
Canton-Chungking Railway and then crosses together
on the same bridge to Chungking on the other side
of the river. The length of this line including branches,
is about 1,200 miles.</p>

<h4>b. The Great Eastern Port-Canton Line</h4>

<p>This is a straight line from one first-class seaport to
another. It starts from the Great Eastern Port and
goes to Hangchow, then turning southwestward, follows
the left bank of the Tsien Tang River through
Fuyang, Tunglu to Yenchow and Chuchow. Then it
proceeds across the Chekiang-Kiangsi border to
Kwangsin. From Kwangsin it goes through Shangtsing
and Kinki to Kienchang, then proceeds to Nanfeng,
Kwangchang, and Ningtu. After Ningtu it
proceeds to Yutu, Sinfeng, Lungnan, and crossing the
boundary mountain of Kiangsi and Kwangtung, to
Changning. Thence via Tsungfa it goes to Canton,
covering a distance of about 900 miles.</p>

<h4>c. The Foochow-Chinkiang Line</h4>

Yiwu, Chukih, and Hangchow. After Hangchow it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
goes to Tehtsing and Huchow and then crosses the
Chekiang border into Kiangsu. Then it proceeds by
way of Ihing, Kintan, and Tanyang to Chinkiang. This
line is about 550 miles in length.</p>

<h4>d. The Foochow-Wuchang Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Foochow and following the
left bank of the Min River and passing Shuikow and
Yenping reaches Shaowu. After Shaowu, it proceeds
across the Fukien border into Kiangsi and then passes
through Kienchang and Fuchow to Nanchang, the
capital of Kiangsi. From Nanchang it proceeds to
Hingkwo, in Hupeh, and passes on to Wuchang, the
capital of Hupeh. It covers a distance of about 550
miles.</p>

<h4>e. The Foochow-Kweilin Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Foochow, crosses the Min
River and proceeds by way of Yungfu, Tatien, Ningyang,
and Liencheng to Tingchow. Thence it crosses
the Fukien-Kiangsi border to Shuikin. From Shuikin
it proceeds to Yutu and Kanchow and then to Shangyiu
and Chungyi. After Chungyi it crosses the
Kiangsi-Hunan border to Kweiyanghsien and Chenchow,
where it crosses the Canton-Hankow line to
Kweiyangchow. Thence it continues to Sintien, Ningyuan,
and Taochow, where it meets lines (a) and (b)
of the Canton-Chungking Railway. After Taochow it
turns southward following the Taoho Valley to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Kwangsi border and then crossing it, proceeds to
Kweilin. This line covers a distance of about 750
miles.</p>

<h4>f. The Wenchow-Shenchow Line</h4>

<p>This line begins from the new Wenchow Port and
follows the left bank of the Wukiang as far as Tsingtien.
From Tsingtien it proceeds to Chuchow and
Suenping and turns westward across the Chekiang
border to Yushan in Kiangsi. After Yushan it goes to
Tehsing, Loping, and then skirting the southern shore
of Poyang Lake goes through Yukan to Nanchang,
the capital of Kiangsi. From Nanchang it proceeds to
Juichow, Shangkao, and Wantsai, then crosses the
Kiangsi border to Liuyang in Hunan, and Changsha,
the capital of Hunan. After Changsha it goes to Ningsiang,
Anhwa, and Shenchow where it connects with
line (a) of the Canton-Chungking Railway, and with
the Shasi-Singyi line. This line covers a distance of
about 850 miles.</p>

<h4>g. The Amoy-Kienchang Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from the new port of Amoy and
goes to Changtai, then following the Kiulungkiang to
Changping, Ningyang, Tsingliu, and Kienning. After
Kienning it proceeds across the Kiangsi border to
Kienchang, where it connects with the Great Eastern
Port-Canton line, the Foochow-Wuchang line, and the
Kienchang-Yuanchow line. This line covers a distance
of about 250 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<h4>h. The Amoy-Canton Line</h4>

<p>This line starts at the new port of Amoy, and proceeds
to Changchow, Nantsing, and Siayang, where it
crosses the Fukien border to Tapu, in Kwangtung.
From Tapu it goes to Tsungkow, Kaying, Hinning,
and Wuhwa. After Wuhwa it crosses the watershed
between the Hankiang and the Tungkiang rivers to
Lungchan, then following the Tungkiang down to Hoyun,
it crosses another watershed to Lungmoon,
Tsengshin and Canton. This line covers a distance of
about 400 miles.</p>

<h4>i. The Swatow-Changteh Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Swatow, proceeds to Chaochow,
Kaying, and then crosses the Kwangtung border
to Changning in Kiangsi. From Changning it crosses
the watershed into Kungkiang Valley and follows that
river down to Hweichang and Kanchow. From Kanchow
it proceeds to Lungchuan, Yungning, and
Lienhwa, where it crosses the Kiangsi border into
Hunan. After that, it proceeds to Chuchow and
Changsha, the capital of Hunan. From Changsha it
goes to Ningsiang, Yiyang, and Changteh where it
ends, connecting with the Great Eastern Port-Chungking
line, and the Shasia-Singyi line. This line covers
a distance of about 650 miles.</p>

<h4>j. The Nanking-Siuchow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Nanking and runs along the
right bank of the Yangtze to Taiping, Wuhu, Tungling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Chichow, and Tungliu. After Tungliu it passes over
the Anhwei border into Kiangsi, at Pengtseh, and goes
to Hukow. At Hukow it meets the Great Eastern
Port-Chungking line and crosses the bridge together
with that line to the projected Poyang Port. From the
Poyang Port it runs along the west shore of the Poyang
Lake through Nanking and Wucheng to Nanchang,
where it meets the Wenchow-Shenchow and Foochow-Wuchang
lines. From Nanchang it proceeds up the
Kan Kiang Valley, via Linkiang to Kian, where it
crosses the projected Kienchang-Yuanchow line. After
Kian, it proceeds to Kanchow where it crosses the
Foochow-Kweilin line. Thence it goes to Nankanghsien
and Nanan. After Nanan it crosses the boundary
mountain, Tayuling, into Kwangtung at Nanyung,
thence passes through Chihing to Siuchow, where it
meets the Canton-Hankow line. This line covers a distance
of about 800 miles.</p>

<h4>k. The Nanking-Kaying Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Nanking, proceeds to Lishui
and Kaoshun and then crosses the Kiangsu border into
Anhwei at Suencheng. From Suencheng it proceeds to
Ningkwo and Hweichow. After Hweichow it crosses
the Anhwei border into Chekiang, passing through
Kaihwa, Changshan, and Kiangshan, and leaving Chekiang
enters Fukien at Pucheng. From Pucheng it
proceeds via Kienningfu to Yenping where it crosses
the Foochow-Wuchang line and then goes through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Shahsien and Yungan to Ningyang, where it meets the
Foochow-Kweilin and Amoy-Kienchang lines. From
Ningyang it proceeds to Lungyen and Yungting, then
joining the Amoy-Canton line at Tsungkow proceeds
together to Kaying, its terminus. This line runs over
a distance of about 750 miles.</p>

<h4>l. The Coast Line Between the Great Eastern and the Great Southern Ports</h4>

<p>This line starts from the Great Southern Port&mdash;Canton&mdash;proceeds
in the same direction as the Canton-Kowloon
line as far as Shelung and then goes its own way
following the course of the Tungkiang River to Waichow.
From Waichow it proceeds to Samtochuck,
Haifung, and Lukfung, then turning northeastward
goes to Kityang and Chaochow. After Chaochow it
goes to Jaoping, then crossing the Kwangtung-Fukien
border to Chaoan. Thence it proceeds to Yunsiao,
Changpu, Changchow, and Amoy. From Amoy it
proceeds to Chuanchow, Hinghwa, and Foochow, the
capital of Fukien. After Foochow it proceeds in the
same direction as the Foochow-Chinkiang line, as far
as Fuan, then turns eastward to Funing, and northward
to Futing. After Futing it crosses the Fukien
border into Chekiang and proceeds through Pingyang
to Wenchow. At Wenchow it crosses the Wukiang
and proceeds to Lotsing, Hwangyen, and Taichow.
Thence, it proceeds through Ninghai to Ningpo, its
own terminus, where it connects with the Ningpo-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>Hangchow
line, thus linking it up with the Great
Eastern Port via Hangchow. This line covers a distance
from Canton to Ningpo of about 1,100 miles.</p>

<h4>m. The Kienchang-Yuanchow Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Kienchang and runs through
Yihwang, Loan, Yungfeng, and Kishui to Kian, where
it crosses the Nanking-Siuchow line. After Kian it
proceeds to Yungsin and Lienhwa where it meets the
Swatow-Changteh line. Thence it crosses the Kiangsi
border into Hunan, at Chaling, then through Anjen to
Hengchow where it crosses the Canton-Hankow line.
From Hengchow the line proceeds to Paoking where
it crosses line (a) of the Canton-Chungking Railway
then westward to Yuanchow, its terminus, where it
joins with the Shasi-Singyi line. This line covers a
distance of about 550 miles. The total length of this
Southeastern Railway System is about 9,000 miles.</p>

<h3>PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">The Northeastern Railway System</span></h3>

<p>This system will cover the whole of Manchuria, a
part of Mongolia, and a part of Chihli province&mdash;an
area of nearly 500,000 square miles, with a population
of 25,000,000. This region is surrounded by mountains
on three sides and opens on the south to the Liaotung
Gulf. Amidst these three mountain ranges lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
a vast and fertile plain drained by three rivers&mdash;the
Nonni on the north, the Sungari on the northeast, and
the Liaoho on the south. This part of China was once
regarded as a desert, but since the completion of the
Chinese Eastern Railway it has been found to be the
most productive soil in China. It supplies the whole of
Japan and a part of China with nitrogenous food in
the form of soya bean. This bean, the wonderful
properties of which were early discovered by the Chinese,
contains the richest nitrogenous substance among
vegetables and has been used as a meat substitute for
many thousand years. Vegetable milk is extracted
from this bean, and from this milk various kinds of
preparations are made. The extraction from this bean
has been proved by modern chemists to be richer than
any kind of meat. The Chinese and the Japanese have
used this kind of artificial meat and milk from time
immemorial. Recently food administrators in Europe
and America have paid great attention to this meat
substitute, while the export of soya bean to Europe
and America has steadily increased. This Manchu-Mongolian
plain is destined to be the source of the
world's supply of soya bean. Besides soya bean, this
plain also produces a great quantity of various kinds
of grains, and supplies the entire Eastern Siberia with
wheat. The Manchurian mountains are exceedingly
rich in timber and minerals&mdash;gold being especially
found in great quantities in many localities.</p>

<p>Railway construction in this region has proved to be
a most profitable undertaking. At present there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
already three railway systems tapping this rich country,
viz., the Peking-Mukden line, the best paying railroad
in China, the Japanese South-Manchurian Railway,
also a very remunerative line, and the Chinese Eastern
Railway, the best paying portion of the whole Siberian
system. Besides these, there are many lines projected
by the Japanese. In order to develop this rich region
properly a network of railways should be projected.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the separate lines of this network
of railways, I should like to propose a center for
them, just as the spider's nest is to a cobweb. I shall
name this central city "Tungchin," the Eastern Mart,
which should be situated at a point southwest of the
junction of the Sungari and Nonni rivers, about 110
miles west by south from Harbin, and will be in a
more advantageous position than the latter. This new
city will be the center not only of the railway system but
also of the inland water communication when the
Liaoho-Sungari Canal is completed.</p>

<p>With the projected city of Tungchin as a center, I
propose the following lines:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Tungchin-Hulutao line.</li>
<li>b. The Tungchin-Great Northern Port line.</li>
<li>c. The Tungchin-Dolon Nor line.</li>
<li>d. The Tungchin-Kerulen line</li>
<li>e. The Tungchin-Moho line.</li>
<li>f. The Tungchin-Korfen line.</li>
<li>g. The Tungchin-Yaoho line.</li>
<li>h. The Tungchin-Yenchi line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></li>
<li>i. The Tungchin-Changpeh line.</li>
<li>j. The Hulutao-Jehol-Peking line.</li>
<li>k. The Hulutao-Kerulen line.</li>
<li>l. The Hulutao-Hailar line.</li>
<li>m. The Hulutao-Antung line.</li>
<li>n. The Moho-Suiyuan line.</li>
<li>o. The Huma-Chilalin or Shihwei line.</li>
<li>p. The Ussuri-Tumen-Yalu-Coast line.</li>
<li>q. The Linkiang-Dolon Nor line.</li>
<li>r. The Chikatobo-Sansing or Ilan line.</li>
<li>s. The Sansing or Ilan-Kirin line.</li>
<li>t. The Kirin-Dolon Nor line.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Tungchin-Hulutao Line</h4>

<p>This is the first line that radiates from this projected
Manchurian railway center, and is the shorter of the
two direct lines that lead to the ice-free ports on the
Liaotung-Chihli Gulf. It runs almost parallel to the
South Manchurian Railway, the distance between the
two lines being about 80 miles at the northern end, converging
to 40 miles at Sinmin, and diverging again
after that point. According to the original agreement
with the former Russian Government, no parallel line
within 100 miles was allowed to be built. But such
restriction must be abolished under this new International
Development Scheme for the benefit of all concerned.
This line starts from Tungchin, and proceeds
southward across the vast Manchurian plain by Changling,
Shuangshan, Liaoyuan, and Kangping, to Sinmin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
in a straight line covering a distance of about 270 miles.
After Sinmin, the line joins the Peking-Mukden Railway
and runs on the same track for a distance of
about 130 miles to Hulutao.</p>

<h4>b. The Tungchin-Great Northern Port Line</h4>

<p>This line is the second that radiates from this railway
center direct to a deep water ice-free seaport. It
starts from Tungchin, proceeding in a southwesterly
direction, passes Kwangan, midway between Tungchin
and the West Liaoho, and many other small settlements
before it crosses the Liaoho. After crossing the
Liaoho, it enters the mountainous regions of the Jehol
district by a valley to Fowsin, a hsien city, and crosses
the watershed into the Talingho Valley. After passing
through the Talingho Valley, the line crosses
another watershed into the Luan Valley by a branch of
the same river. Then it penetrates the Great Wall and
proceeds to the Great Northern Port by way of Yungping
and Loting. The whole length of this line is
about 550 miles, the first half of which is on level
land and the second half in mountainous country.</p>

<h4>c. The Tungchin-Dolon Nor Line</h4>

<p>This is the third line that radiates from the railway
center and proceeds nearly in a westerly direction across
the plain to Taonan where it crosses the projected
Aigun-Jehol line (Japanese), and also meets the termini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of two other projected lines, the Changchun-Taonan
and the Tsengkiatun-Taonan (Japanese). After
Taonan, the line turns more southward by skirting
along the foothills of the southeastern side of the
Great Khingan range where vast virgin forests and
rich minerals are found. Then it passes through the
upper Liaoho Valley formed by the Great Khingan
Mountain on the north, and the Jehol Mountain on the
south and through the towns of Linsi and Kingpang
to Dolon Nor, where it meets the trunk line of the
Northwestern Railway system. This line covers a
distance of about 480 miles, a greater part of which
is on level land.</p>

<h4>d. The Tungchin-Kerulen Line</h4>

<p>This is the fourth line that radiates from the Tungchin
Railway center. It runs in a northwesterly direction
almost parallel with the Harbin-Manchuli line of
the Chinese Eastern Railway, the distance between the
two lines varying from 100 to 130 miles. The line
starts from Tungchin on the north side of the junction
of the Nonni and Sungari rivers and proceeds westward
across the Nonni River to Talai, and then turns
northwestward across the plain into the valley of the
north branch of the Guileli River. After entering the
valley, it follows the stream up to its source, then
crosses the Great Khingan Mountain watershed into the
Mongolian Plain by the Khalka River, and follows the
right bank of this river to the north end of Bor Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Lake. Thence it turns directly westward to the Kerulen
River, and follows the south bank of the river to
Kerulen. This line covers a distance of about 630
miles.</p>

<h4>e. The Tungchin-Moho Line</h4>

<p>This is the fifth line that radiates from this railway
center. It starts from the north side of the junction
of the Nonni and Sungari rivers, and proceeds northwestward
across the northern end of the Great Manchurian
Plain to Tsitsiha. At Tsitsiha, it joins the
projected Kinchow-Aigun line and proceeds together
northwestward alongside the left bank of the Nonni
River as far as Nunkiang where it separates from the
other. Thence it resumes the northwesterly direction
and proceeds into the upper Nonni Valley until the
headwater is reached. Then it crosses the northern
extremity of the Great Khingan Range to Moho,
where it joins the terminus of the Dolon Nor-Moho
line. This line is about 600 miles long. About a
quarter of this length runs on the plain, the second
quarter runs along the lower Nonni Valley, the third
along the Upper Valley, and the fourth runs in mountainous
but gold-bearing regions, where only physical
difficulties are to be expected.</p>

<h4>f. The Tungchin-Korfen Line</h4>

<p>This is the sixth line from the railway center. It
also starts on the northern side of the Nonni-Sungari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
junction, and proceeds across the plain by the cities
Chaotung and Tsingkang. After Tsingkang it crosses
the Tungkun River, proceeds to Hailun, and then,
ascending the Tungkun Valley, crosses the watershed
of the Little Khingan Mountain. Thence it descends
into the Korfen Valley and proceeds by Chelu to
Korfen on the right bank of the Amur River. This
line covers a distance of 350 miles, two thirds of which
run on comparatively level land and one third in mountainous
district. This is the shortest line from Tungchin
to the Amur River and the Russian territory on
yonder side.</p>

<h4>g. The Tungchin-Yaoho Line</h4>

<p>This is the seventh line that radiates from this railway
center. It starts from the northern side of the
Nonni-Sungari junction and traverses the plain on the
left of the Sungari River by Chaochow, then crosses
the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Hulan River to
Hulan. After Hulan, it proceeds to Payen, Mulan,
and Tungho, then crosses the Sungari River to Sansing,
now called Ilan. Thence it proceeds into the
Wokan Valley and crosses the watershed by Chihsingshitse
and Takokai into the Noloho Valley and passing
by various villages and towns along this river to
Yaohohsien, ends at the junction of the Noloho and
the Ussuri River. This line covers a distance of 500
miles in very fertile country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<h4>h. The Tungchin-Yenchi Line</h4>

<p>This is the eighth line that radiates from this railway
center. It starts from the eastern side of the Nonni-Sungari
junction and proceeds in a southeasterly direction
on the right side of the Sungari River to Fuyu
or Petunai and various towns along the road on the
same side of the river until it comes across the Harbin-Talien
Railway, then turns away from the road and
proceeds eastward to Yushu and Wuchang. After
Wuchang, the line turning more southward, proceeds
to Fengtechang and then follows the same direction to
Omu. At Omu, it crosses the Mutan River, then
proceeds to Liangshuichuan and Shehtauho, where it
joins the Japanese Hweining-Kirin line and proceeds
together to Yenchi. This line covers a length of about
330 miles through very rich agricultural and mineral
country.</p>

<h4>i. The Tungchin-Changpeh Line</h4>

<p>This is the ninth line that radiates from the Tungchin
railway center. It starts from the south side of
the Nonni-Sungari junction and proceeds in a southeasterly
direction across the plain to Nungan. After
Nungan, it crosses the Itung River and proceeds continuously
in the same direction across several branches
of the same river to Kiudaichan, where it joins the
Changchun-Kirin line and proceeds together as far as
Kirin. After Kirin, it goes its own way following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
right bank of the Sungari River in a southeasterly
direction to the junction of Lafaho River and turns
southward along the same bank of the Sungari to
Huatien. After Huatien, it continues in the same
course up to Toutaokiang, as far as Fusung, then turns
southeastward into the Sunghsiangho Valley and
proceeds upward to the Changpeh Shan watershed by
skirting the south side of the Celestial Lake, then turns
southward following the Aikiang River to Changpeh
on the Korean frontier. This line covers a distance
of about 330 miles. Some great difficulties are to be
overcome in the last portion of the line where it crosses
the Changpeh watershed.</p>

<h4>j. The Hulutao-Jehol-Peking Line</h4>

<p>With this line I shall begin to deal with a new group
of the Northeastern Railway System which will make
Hulutao, the ice-free port on the Liaotung Gulf as
their center and terminus. This, the first line, starts
from Hulutao and proceeds westward up the Shaho
Valley to Sintaipienmen. Thence it crosses the mountainous
district through Haiting, Mangniuyingtse, and
Sanshihkiatse to Pingchuan, and continues in the same
direction to Jehol or Chengteh. After Jehol, it
proceeds by the old imperial highway to Lwanping,
then turns southwestward to Kupehkow where it
penetrates the Great Wall. Thence it follows the same
highway through Miyun and Shunyi to Peking. This
line covers a distance of about 270 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<h4>k. The Hulutao-Kerulen Line</h4>

<p>This is the second line of the Hulutao radiation. It
starts from this seaport and proceeds northward
through the mountainous region of Jehol by Kienping
and Chihfeng. Thence, the line follows the highway
across the Upper Valley of Liaoho to Chianchang,
Sitoo, Takinkou, and Linsi. After Linsi, it proceeds
up the Lukiako Valley and crosses the watershed at the
southern extremity of the Great Khingan Mountain,
through Kanchumiao and Yufuchih. Then it proceeds
to Payenbolak, Uniket, and Khombukure where
it joins with the Dolon Nor-Kerulen line and proceeds
together to Kerulen. This line up to Khombukure
covers a distance of about 450 miles, tapping a very
rich mineral, timber, and agricultural country.</p>

<h4>l. The Hulutao-Hailar Line</h4>

<p>This, the third line, starts from Hulutao and proceeds
by way of Chinchow along the west side on the
Talingho River to Yichow, where it crosses the
Talingho to Chinghopienmen and Fowsin. After
Fowsin, the line goes northward to Suitung, thence,
crossing the Siliaoho to Kailu, it proceeds between the
Great and Little Fish Lakes to Kinpan and Tachuan.
Then it proceeds across the Great Khingan Mountain
into the Oman Valley and follows the same river to
Hailar. This line covers a distance of about 600 miles
passing through rich mineral and agricultural land and
virgin forests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<h4>m. The Hulutao-Antung Line</h4>

<p>This, the fourth line, starts from Hulutao and proceeding
northeastward, follows the course of the
projected Liaoho-Hulutao Canal, and then goes eastward
to Newchwang and Haicheng. From there it
proceeds southeastward to Sinmuchen, where it joins
the Antung-Mukden line and proceeds together to
Antung on the Korean border. This line covers a
distance of about 220 miles. This together with the
Hulutao-Jehol-Peking line will make the shortest line
from Antung and beyond, i.e., Korea, to Peking.</p>

<h4>n. The Moho-Suiyuan Line</h4>

<p>With this as the first I am going to deal with another
group of lines in this system. These will be the
circumferential lines which link up the radii from the
Tungchin center in two semicircles, the outer and the
inner. This Moho-Suiyuan line starts from Moho and
proceeds along the right bank of the Amur River to
Ussuri, Omurh, Panga, Kaikukang, Anlo, and Woshimen.
After this point, the river bends more southward
and the line follows the same bend to Ankan,
Chahayen, Wanghata, and Huma. From Huma, it
proceeds to Sierhkenchi, Chila, Manchutun, Heiho,
and Aigun where it meets the terminus of the Chinchow-Aigun
line. After Aigun, the line turns more
eastward to Homolerhchin, Chilirh, and Korfen where
it meets the terminus of the Tungchin-Korfen line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Thence it proceeds to Wuyun, Foshan, and Lopeh.
After Lopeh, it goes to Hokang at the junction of the
Amur and Sungari. At this point, the line crosses the
Sungari River to Tungkiang and proceeds to Kaitsingkow,
Otu, and Suiyuan where it ends. This line covers
a distance of 900 miles running all its way through the
gold-producing region.</p>

<h4>o. The Huma-Chilalin or Shihwei Line</h4>

<p>This is merely a branch of the Moho-Suiyuan line.
It starts from Huma and follows the Kumara River
passing by the Taleitse Gold Mine and Wapalakow
Gold Mine. Then it proceeds up the Kumara River
in a westerly and southwesterly direction to its southern
source and there it crosses the watershed into the
Halarh Valley, thence descending the valley to Chilalin
or Shihwei. This line covers a distance of about 320
miles running in an extremely rich gold district.</p>

<h4>p. The Ussuri-Tumen-Yalu-Coast Line</h4>

<p>This, the second line of the outer semicircle, starts
by continuing the first line at Suiyuan, and proceeds
along the left bank of the Ussuri River, passing
Kaulan, Fuyeu, and Minkang, to Yaoho, where it
meets the terminus of the Tungchin-Yaoho line. From
Yaoho, it runs parallel to the Russian Ussuri Railway
on the east side of the river as far as Fulin. After
Fulin, it parts from the Russian line by turning westward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
following the Mulingho River to Mishan on the
northwestern corner of the Hanka Lake. Thence it
goes to Pinganchin, turns southward alongside the
boundary line and crosses the Harbin-Vladivostok
line at Siusuifen Station to Tungning. After Tungning,
it continues the same southward course alongside
the boundary line to a point between Szetaukow
and Wutaukow, then turns westward to Hunchun, and
northwestward to Yenchi where it meets the projected
Japanese Hweining-Kirin line. From Yenchi, it follows
the Japanese line to Holung, and proceeds southwestward
by the left side of the Tumen River across
the watershed into the Yalu Valley, where it meets the
Tungchin-Changpeh line. After Changpeh it turns
westward and northwestward following the right bank
of the Yalu to Linkiang, thence southwestward, still
following the right bank of the Yalu, to Tsianhsien
and then continues in the same direction, along the
Yalu bank, to Antung, where it meets the Antung-Mukden
Railway. After Antung, it proceeds to
Tatungkow at the mouth of the Yalu, thence along
the coast to Takushan and Chwangho, then westward
through Situn and Pingfangtien to join the South
Manchurian Railway at Wukiatun. This line covers
a distance of 1,100 miles, which runs from end to end
right along the southeastern boundary of Manchuria.</p>

<h4>q. The Linkiang-Dolon Nor Line</h4>

<p>This is the third line of the outer semicircle of the
Tungchin railway center, and connects the radiating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
lines south of the center. It starts from Linkiang at
the southwestward turn of the Yalu River, and proceeds
across the mountainous region passing by
Tunghwa, Hingking, and Fushun, to Mukden, where
it crosses the South Manchurian Railway. From
Mukden, it goes together with the Peking-Mukden line
as far as Sinmin, where it crosses the Tungchin-Hulutao
line and proceeds northwestward through
Sinlihtun to Fowsin. After Fowsin the line enters the
hilly district of the upper Liaoho Valley, and proceeds
to Chihfeng, after passing through numerous small
villages and camping places in this vast pasture. After
Chihfeng the line proceeds through the Yinho Valley
by Sanchotien, Kungchuling, and Tachientse, to
Famuku, thence follows the Tulakanho to Dolon Nor,
covering a distance of about 500 miles.</p>

<h4>r. The Chikatobo-Sansing or Ilan Line</h4>

<p>This is the first line of the inner semicircle which
connects the radiating lines from the Tungchin railway
center on the northeast. It starts from Chikatobo on
the upper reach of the Amur, and proceeds eastward
and southeastward through many valleys and mountains
of the Great Khingan Range to Nunkiang. After
Nunkiang, it goes in a more southerly direction to
Keshan, thence to Hailun, and then crosses the Sungari
to Sansing or Ilan. This line covers a distance of
about 700 miles, passing through an agricultural and
gold-producing country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<h4>s. The Sansing or Ilan-Kirin Line</h4>

<p>This is the second line of the inner semicircle. It
starts from Sansing and proceeds southwestward along
the right bank of the Mutan River through Tauchan,
Erchan, Sanchan, and Szuchan, to Chengtse where it
crosses the Harbin-Vladivostok line. Then it goes to
Ninguta, after crossing over the Mutan River from
right to the left bank. After Ninguta it proceeds
southwestward passing through Wungcheng, Lanchichan,
Talachan, and Fungwangtien, to Omu. From
Omu it joins the Japanese Hweining-Kirin line and
proceeds westward to Kirin. This line covers a distance
of about 200 miles, along the fertile Mutan
Valley.</p>

<h4>t. The Kirin-Dolon Nor Line</h4>

<p>This is the third line of the inner semicircle in the
Tungchin system. It starts from Kirin and follows
the old highway westward to Changchun where it
meets the termini of the Chinese Eastern Railway from
the north and the Japanese South Manchurian Railway
from the south. After Changchun, it proceeds across
the plain to Shuangshan where it meets the Tungchin-Hulutao
line and the Japanese Szupingkai-Chengkiatun-Taonan
line. From Shuangshan, it crosses the
Liao River to Liaoyuan, thence it traverses the vast
plain, crossing the Tungchin-Great Northern Port line
and goes to Suitung where it meets the Hulutao-Hailar
line. After Suitung, it proceeds up the Liao Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
where it comes across the Hulutao-Kerulen line and
then crosses the watershed to Dolon Nor where it ends.
This line covers a distance of 500 miles. This completes
the cobweb system of the projected North-Eastern
Railway. The total length of this entire
system is about 9,000 miles.</p>

<h3>PART IV<br />

<span class="subhead">The Extension of the Northwestern Railway System</span></h3>

<p>The Northwestern Railway System covers the region
of Mongolia, Sinkiang, and a part of Kansu, an
area of 1,700,000 square miles. This territory exceeds
the area of the Argentine Republic by 600,000 square
miles. Argentina is now the greatest source of the
world's meat supply, while the Mongolian pasture is
not yet developed, owing to the lack of transportation
facilities. As Argentina has superseded the United
States in supplying the world with meat, so the Mongolian
pasture will some day take the place of
Argentina, when railways are developed and cattle
raising is scientifically improved. Thus the construction
of railroads in this vast food-producing region is
an urgent necessity as a means of relieving the world
from food shortage. In the first program of this
International Development Scheme, I proposed 7,000
miles of railways for this vast and fertile region, for the
purpose of developing the Great Northern Port, and
relieving the congested population of southeastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
China. But this 7,000 miles of railways form merely
a pioneer line. In order to develop this virgin continent
properly, more railways have to be constructed.
Therefore in this plan, namely, the Extension of the
Northwestern Railway System, I propose the following
lines:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Dolon Nor-Kiakata line.</li>
<li>b. The Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola line.</li>
<li>c. The Suiyuan-Uliassutai-Kobdo line.</li>
<li>d. The Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line.</li>
<li>e. The Suchow-Kobdo line.</li>
<li>f. The Northwestern Frontier line.</li>
<li>g. The Tihwa or Urumochi-Ulankom line.</li>
<li>h. The Gaskhiun-Tannu Ola line.</li>
<li>i. The Uliassutai-Kiakata line.</li>
<li>j. The Chensi or Barkul-Urga line.</li>
<li>k. The Suchow-Urga line.</li>
<li>l. The Desert Junction-Kerulen line.</li>
<li>m. The Khobor-Kerulen-Chikatobo line.</li>
<li>n. The Wuyuan-Taonan line.</li>
<li>o. The Wuyuan-Dolon Nor line.</li>
<li>p. The Yenki-Ili line.</li>
<li>q. The Ili-Hotien line.</li>
<li>r. The Chensi-Kashgar line and its branches.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Dolon Nor-Kiakata Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Dolon Nor and proceeds in a
northwesterly direction, following the caravan road
across the vast pasture to Khorkho, Kuoto, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Suliehto. After Suliehto, it crosses the boundary line
into Outer Mongolia by the same road to Khoshentun,
Lukuchelu, and Yangto. Thence it crosses the Kerulen
River to Otukunkholato, and enters the hilly region
where it crosses the Kerulen watershed and the Chikoi
watershed. The water from the Kerulen watershed
flows into the Amur, and thence into the Pacific Ocean,
while the water from the Chikoi watershed flows into
Lake Baikal, and thence to the Arctic Ocean. After
crossing the Chikoi watershed, it follows a branch of
the Chikoi River to Kiakata. This line covers a distance
of about 800 miles.</p>

<h4>b. The Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Kalgan at the Great Wall, and
proceeds northwestward up the plateau, crosses a range
of hills into the Mongolian prairie, and goes to
Mingan, Boroldshi, Ude, and Khobor, where it crosses
the Dolon Nor-Urumochi trunk line. After Khobor,
it proceeds across the vast and rich pasture of Mubulan,
then proceeds in a straight line through Mukata and
Nalaiha to Urga. From Urga, it goes into the hilly
district crossing Selenga Valley to a point opposite the
southern end of Lake Kos Gol, and then turns northward
across a range of mountains to Khatkhyl on the
southern shore of Kos Gol. After Khatkhyl, it skirts
Kos Gol Lake along the western shore for some distance,
then turns northwestward and westward, following
the course of the Khua Kem River to a point near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
its exit at the frontier line, then turns southwestward
up the Kemtshik Valley to its headwater, passes
through Pakuoshwo, and ends at the boundary line
between the Russian and Chinese territories. This line
covers a distance of about 1,700 miles.</p>

<h4>c. The Suiyuan-Uliassutai-Kobdo Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Suiyuan in the northwestern
corner of Shansi, and proceeds in a northwesterly
direction across the hilly country into the Mongolian
pasture to Tolibulyk, where it crosses the Great Northern
Port-Hami line, and the Great Eastern Port-Urga
line. After Tolibulyk, it proceeds in a straight line in
the same direction passing through Barunsudshi to the
capital of Tuchetu. Thence it continues in the same
straight line northwestward to Gorida. After Gorida,
it follows the caravan road to Kolitikolik where it
crosses the Great Northern Port-Urumochi trunk
line. From Kolitikolik, the line turns northwestward,
then westward and proceeds across many streams and
valleys and passes by many small towns to Uliassutai.
At Uliassutai, it crosses the B. Junction-Frontier
branch of the Great Eastern Port-Urumochi line.
After Uliassutai, the line proceeds westward following
the trade road, passes through Khuduku, Bogu,
Durganor, and Sakhibuluk to Kobdo. Thence the line
turns northwestward to Khonga, Ukha, and Clegei,
then westward to Beleu and ends at the frontier. This
line is about 1,500 miles long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<h4>d. The Tsingpien-Tannu Ola Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Tsingpien at the Great Wall,
on the northern border of Shensi, proceeds through the
Ordos country by Bonobalgasun, Orto, and Shinchao,
and then crosses the Hoangho to Santaoho. From
Santaoho, it proceeds across Charanarinula Mountain
into Mongolian prairie in a northwesterly direction to
Kurbansihata where it crosses the Peking-Hami line,
then it goes to Unikuto and Enkin, where it crosses
the Great Northern Port-Urumochi line. After Enkin,
the line enters into a valley and watered district, proceeds
northward to Karakorum, and then turns northwestward
across various streams and valleys of the
tributary of the Selenga River by Sabokatai and
Tsulimiau. After Tsulimiau, it proceeds in the same
direction across the Selenga River, follows its branch,
the Telgir Morin River, up to its source and crosses
the watershed into Lake Teri Nor. Then it follows
the outlet of the Teri Nor to the Khua Kem River,
where it ends by joining the Kalgan Urga-Tannu Ola
line. This line covers a distance of about 1,200 miles.</p>

<h4>e. The Suchow-Kobdo Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Suchow in a northwesterly
direction penetrating the Great Wall at Chiennew, and
proceeds to the coal field, about 150 miles from Suchow.
Then it goes to Habirhaubuluk and Ilatoli. A
short way from this place the line comes across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Peking-Hami line and then proceeds to Balaktai.
After this the line passes a bit of pure desert to Timenchi.
After entering the hilly and watered country
it proceeds to Gaskhiu where it crosses the Great
Northern Port-Urumochi trunk line. After Gaskhiun,
it proceeds to Wolanhutok, Tabateng, and Tabutu
where it joins the Kucheng and Kobdo highway and
following it, proceeds to Kobdo, through Batokuntai
and Sutai. Here the line ends, covering a distance of
about 700 miles.</p>

<h4>f. The Northwestern Frontier Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Ili following the Urumochi-Ili
line to Santai, on the eastern side of Zairam Lake, then
proceeds northeastward by itself to Tuszusai on the
west side of Ebi Lake. After Tuszusai it proceeds to
Toli where it crosses the Central Trunk line, that is,
the Great Eastern Port-Tarbogotai line. Thence it
goes to Namukotai and Stolokaitai by passing through
a vast forest and a rich coal field. From Stolokaitai,
the line follows the highway and proceeds to Chenghwaszu,
the capital of Altai province. Thence it
crosses a mountain range by the Urmocaitu Pass into
the Kobdo Valley, and follows the course of the Kobdo
River to Beleu where it joins the Suiyuan-Kobdo line
and proceeds to Clegei. From Clegei, it proceeds by
itself to Tabtu via Usungola and Ulamkom. At Tabtu,
it joins the other line again and proceeds together to
the Khua Kem River in the Tannu Ola district. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
then turns eastward ascending the river to the junction
of the Bei Kem and Khua Kem rivers, then starts again
on its own course, following the former river and proceeds
up to its source in a northeasterly direction ending
at the frontier. This line covers a distance of about
900 miles.</p>

<h4>g. The Tihwa or Urumochi-Ulankom Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Tihwa following the Dolon
Nor trunk line to Fowkang, then proceeds by its own
route almost northward through Chipichuan to Khorchute.
From Khorchute, it turns northeastward and
proceeds across a hilly district to Kaiche, then to
Turhuta, where it crosses a branch line from Junction
C. of the Great Northern Port-Urumochi line. After
Turhuta, it turns northward, proceeds up the Pakaningale
Valley to Zehoshita, and then crosses the Tilikta
Pass. Thence it turns northeastward proceeding
across the newly cultivated country to Kobdo. After
Kobdo, it proceeds through a fertile plateau, by crossing
many rivers and skirting many lakes to Ulankom,
where it ends by joining the Northwestern Frontier
line. It covers a distance of about 550 miles.</p>

<h4>h. The Gaskhiun-Tannu Ola Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Gaskhiun and proceeds northeastward
across a hilly and watered country through
Hatonhutuk and Talangjoleu, to Pornulu. After
Pornulu, the line proceeds across the Sapkhyn Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
by Huchirtu and Porkho to Uliassutai where it meets
the Suiyuan-Kobdo, and the Great Eastern Port-Uliassutai
lines. After Uliassutai, the line proceeds northward
to a quite new country by first crossing the headwaters
of Selenga, then the headwaters of the Tess
River. In the Tess Valley the line crosses a vast virgin
forest. After emerging from this forest it proceeds
northwestward across the watershed into the Khua
Kem Valley in Tannu Ola and ends by joining the
Northwestern Frontier line. This line covers a distance
of about 650 miles.</p>

<h4>i. The Uliassutai-Kiakata Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Uliassutai and runs on the
track of the Gaskhiun-Tannu Ola line, until it reaches
the Eder River, a branch of the Selenga. Then, turning
off eastward, it begins its own course and proceeds
downward following the course of the Eder River,
crossing the Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line, to the junction
of this river with the Selenga. There it joins the
Kalgan-Urga-Tannu Ola line and proceeds together
eastward in the common track for some distance until
the other line turns southeastward, when this line turns
northeastward following the Selenga down to Kiakata.
This line covers a distance of about 550 miles, running
through a fertile valley.</p>

<h4>j. The Chensi or Barkul-Urga Line</h4>

northeastward across a cultivated region through Tutaku<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to Urkesiat. After Urkesiat, it crosses the Suchow-Kobdo
line, then traverses the vast pasture on
the north side of the Gobi Desert to Suchi and Dalantura.
Thence it turns more northward across the Great
Eastern Port-Uliassutai line, and the Dolon Nor-Urumochi
line to Tashunhutuk. After this point the line
crosses the Suiyuan-Uliassutai line at Ologai and
proceeds over the watershed into the Selenga Valley
where it crosses the Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line at
Sabokatai. From here it turns eastward across a hilly
and watered region to Urga. This line covers a distance
of about 800 miles.</p>

<h4>k. The Suchow-Urga Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Suchow and proceeds by Kinta
to Maumu, and then follows the Taoho or Edsina
River, which waters this strip of oasis, to the lakes.
Thence it crosses the Gobi Desert, where it meets the
crossing lines of the Peking-Hami and the Great Eastern
Port-Uliassutai railways and with them forms a
common junction. From this junction it proceeds
across desert and pasture lands to another railway
crossing which is formed by the Suiyuan-Kobdo and
Tsingpien-Tannu Ola lines, also forming a common
junction together. Thence it proceeds into pasture
land through Hatengtu and Tolik to Sanintalai, where
it crosses the Dolon Nor-Urumochi line. After Sanintalai,
the line proceeds through Ulanhoshih and many
other small towns and encampments to Urga. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
line covers a distance of about 700 miles. One third
of this length is through the desert and the other two
thirds through watered pasture land.</p>

<h4>l. The Desert Junction-Kerulen Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from the Desert Junction, proceeds
northeastward to the postural land and crosses the
Tsingpien-Tannu Ola line south of Ulan Nor Lake.
Thence it proceeds to the Tuchetu Capital where it
crosses the Suiyuan-Kobdo line. After the Tuchetu
Capital it goes across a pasture to Junction A. From
Junction A. it proceeds to Ulanhutuk and Chientingche,
then crosses the Kalgan-Tannu Ola line to Zesenkhana.
From Zesenkhana, the line follows the course of the
Kerulen River down in a northeasterly direction to the
city of Kerulen, where it crosses the Dolon Nor-Kerulen
line, and meets the Kerulen-Tungchin line. This line
covers a distance of about 800 miles.</p>

<h4>m. The Khobor-Kerulen-Chikatobo Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Khobor, the crossing junction
of the Dolon Nor-Urumochi, and the Kalgan-Urga-Tannu
Ola lines, and proceeds northeastward across a
vast pasture to Khoshentun, where it crosses the Dolon
Nor-Kiakata line. After Khoshentun, it proceeds in
the same direction across a similar pasture to Kerulen,
where it crosses the Dolon Nor-Kerulen line. Then it
proceeds first along the right bank of the Kerulen
River, then crosses to the left side, and passes along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the northwestern side of Hulan Lake. After Hulan
Lake, the line crosses the Chinese Eastern Railway, and
the Arguna River, then proceeds along the right bank
of the river to Chikatobo, where the line ends by joining
the Dolon Nor-Moho and the Chikatobo-Sansing
lines. This line covers a distance of about 600 miles.
The first half of it runs on dry land and the second
half on watered land.</p>

<h4>n. The Wuyuan-Taonan Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Wuyuan at the northwest bend
of the Hoangho and proceeds northeastward across the
Sheiten Ula Mountain and pasture to Tolibulyk, where
it meets the crossing junction of three lines&mdash;the Peking-Hami
line, the Suiyuan-Kobdo line, and the Great
Eastern Port-Urga line. From Tolibulyk the line proceeds
continuously in the same direction across a
pasture to Khobor where it meets the crossing junction
of the Dolon Nor-Urumochi and the Peking-Urga lines,
and also the terminus of the Khobor-Kerulen line.
After Khobor the line turns more eastward and runs
across the Dolon Nor-Kiakata line midway to Khombukure,
where it crosses the Dolon Nor-Kerulen and
the Hulutao-Kerulen lines. From Khombukure the
line proceeds to Dakmusuma, where it crosses the
Dolon Nor-Moho line. Thence it goes eastward across
the Great Khingan Mountain to Tuchuan, then turns
southeastward to Taonan, where it ends. This line

where it crosses the Great Eastern Port-Urga line.
Then it proceeds across the vast pasture and the Suiyuan-Kobdo
line to Bombotu, where it passes over the
Peking-Hami line. After Bombotu, the line turns eastward
and proceeds across the Kalgan-Urga-Tannu
Ola line, then goes to Dolon Nor, where it ends by
joining the Dolon Nor-Mukden-Linkiang line, which
forms a direct route from the upper Hoangho Valley
to the rich Liaoho Valley. This line covers a distance
of about 500 miles.</p>

<h4>p. The Yenki-Ili Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Yenki or Karashar, and proceeds
northwestward across the mountain pass into
the Ili Valley. It then follows the Kunges River downward,
in a westerly direction, traversing a most fertile
valley, to Ining and Kuldja or Ili, the principal city
of the Ili district near the Russian border, where it
joins the Ili-Urumochi line. This line covers a distance
of about 400 miles.</p>

<h4>q. The Ili-Hotien Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Ili or Kuldja, proceeds southward
across the Ili River, then eastward along the left
side of the river and then southeastward and southward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
to Bordai. From here it turns southwestward
into Tekes Valley and proceeding upward crosses the
Tekes River to Tienchiao and then ascends the mountain
pass. After the mountain pass the line turns southeastward,
traverses a vast coal field and then turns
southwestward to Shamudai, where it crosses the Turfan-Kashgar
line. From Shamudai it turns southward
across the fertile zone of the north side of the Tarim
Valley, to Bastutakelak. Then it proceeds southwestward
to Hotien passing by on the way many small
settlements in the fertile zone of the Hotien River
which flows across the desert. At Hotien the line meets
the Kashgar-Iden line. After Hotien the line proceeds
upward to the highland south of the city and ends at
the frontier. This line covers a distance of about 700
miles.</p>

<h4>r. The Chensi-Kashgar Line and Its Branches</h4>

<p>This line starts from Chensi and proceeds southwestward
along the Tienshan pasture through Yenanpoa,
Shihkialoong, and Taolaitse to Chikoching, then
along the Tienshan forest through Wutungkwo, Tungyenchi,
Siyenchi, and Olong to Sensien, where it
crosses the Central Trunk line. After Sensien it proceeds
along the northern edge of the Tarim Desert
through Lakesun City and Shehchuan to Hora, where
it crosses the Cherchen-Koria line. From Hora the line
proceeds along the course of the Tarim River, passing
by many new settlements, fertile regions, and virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
forests, to Bastutakelak, where it crosses the Ili-Hotien
line. Thence it goes through Pachu to Kashgar where
it meets the Urumochi-Iden line. After Kashgar it proceeds
northwestward to the frontier where it ends.
Attached to this line are two branches. The first branch
proceeds from Hora southwestward through many
oases to Cherchen. The second proceeds from Pachu
southwestward along the Yarkand River to Sache and
then westward to Puli near the frontier. This line
including the branches covers a distance of about 1,600
miles. The total length of this entire system is about
16,000 miles. See general map.</p>

<h3>PART V<br />

<span class="subhead">The Highland Railway System</span></h3>

<p>This, the last part of my railway program, is the
most difficult and most expensive undertaking of its
kind; consequently, it must be the least remunerative of
all the railway enterprises in China. So no work should
be attempted in this part until all the other parts are
fully developed. But when all the other parts are
well equipped with railways then railway construction
in this highland region will also be remunerative, despite
the difficulties and the highly expensive work in
construction.</p>

<p>The highland region consists of Tibet, Kokonor, and
a part of Sinkiang, Kansu, Szechwan, and Yunnan, an
area of about 1,000,000 square miles. Tibet is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
to be the richest country in the world for gold deposits.
Furthermore the adjacent territories possess rich agricultural
and pastural lands. This vast region is little
known to the outside world. The Chinese call Tibet
"the Western Treasury," for, besides gold, there are
other kinds of metals especially copper, in great quantities.
Indeed the name of the Western Treasury is
most appropriately applied to this unknown region.
When the world's supply of precious metals are exhausted,
we have to resort to this vast mineral bearing
region for supply. So railways will be necessary at
least for mining purposes. I therefore propose the
following lines:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Lhasa-Lanchow line.</li>
<li>b. The Lhasa-Chengtu line.</li>
<li>c. The Lhasa-Tali-Cheli line.</li>
<li>d. The Lhasa-Taklongshong line.</li>
<li>e. The Lhasa-Yatung line.</li>
<li>f. The Lhasa-Laichiyaling line.</li>
<li>g. The Lhasa-Nohho line.</li>
<li>h. The Lhasa-Iden line.</li>
<li>i. The Lanchow-Chochiang line.</li>
<li>j. The Chengtu-Dzunsasak line.</li>
<li>k. The Ningyuan-Cherchen line.</li>
<li>l. The Chengtu-Menkong line.</li>
<li>m. The Chengtu-Yuankiang line.</li>
<li>n. The Suifu-Tali line.</li>
<li>o. The Suifu-Mengting line.</li>
<li>p. The Iden-Gortok line.</li>
</ul></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<h4>a. The Lhasa-Lanchow Line</h4>

<p>This is the most important line of this system for
it connects the capital city of Tibet&mdash;a vast secluded
region with several millions of people&mdash;with the central
trunk line of the country. The route which it passes
through is inhabitable and is already slightly inhabited
in the region between the ends of the proposed line.
So it will probably be a paying line from the beginning.
This line starts from Lhasa, following the old imperial
highway in a northward direction and proceeds by
Talong to Yarh, which lies on the southeastern side of
Tengri Nor Lake. After Yarh, the line turns more
eastward and proceeds across the watershed from the
Sanpo Valley to the Lukiang Valley by the Shuangtsu
Pass. Thence turning more eastward the line proceeds
across the headwater of the Lukiang to that of the
Yangtze by passing many valleys, streams, and mountain
passes. Then it crosses the main body of the
Upper Yangtze, which is here known as the Kinshakiang,
over the Huhusair Bridge. After crossing the
bridge, it turns southeastward, then eastward across
the Yangtze Valley into the Hoangho Valley, where it
passes through many small towns and encampments
into the Starry Sea region. At the Starry Sea, the line
passes between the lakes of Oring Nor and Tsaring
Nor. Thence it turns northeastward across the southeast
valley of the Zaidam region, and returns into the
Hoangho Valley again. Then it proceeds through
Katolapo and various towns to Dangar, now called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Hwangyuan, situated near the border between Kansu
and Kokonor. After Dangar, the line turns southeastward
following the course of the Sining River, proceeds
downward through a very rich valley and passes
through Sining, Nienpai, and hundreds of small towns
and villages to Lanchow. This line covers a distance
of 1,100 miles.</p>

<h4>b. The Lhasa-Chengtu Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa and proceeds northeastward
on the former imperial highway by Teking and
Nanmo to Motsukungchia. Thence it turns southeastward
and northeastward to Giamda. From Giamda,
the line turns northward, then northeastward where
it proceeds through the Tolala Pass to Lhari. After
Lhari the line goes in an easterly direction and passes
Pianpa, Shihtuh, and many small towns to Lolongchong.
Thence it crosses the Lukiang by the Kayu
Bridge and then turns northeastward to Kinda
and Chiamdo. After Chiamdo, the line instead of
following the imperial highway southeastward to
Batang, turns northeastward, following another
trade route, and proceeds to Payung at the northwestern
corner of Szechwan. From Payung,
it proceeds across the Kinshakiang over the bridge
near Sawusantusze. The line then turns southeastward,
enters the Ichu Valley and proceeds downward
to Kantzu on the Yalung River. Thence it proceeds
to Chango and Yinker, to Badi on the Great Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
River, and Mongan on the Little Golden River. After
Mongan, the line goes through the Balan Pass to
Kwanhsien, and entering the Chengtu Plain, reaches
Chengtu by Pihsien. This line covers a distance of
about 1,000 miles.</p>

<h4>c. The Lhasa-Tali-Cheli Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa by the same track as
the Lhasa-Chengtu line as far as Giamda. From
Giamda, it proceeds by its own track southeastward,
following a branch of the Sanpo River to Yulu, where
this branch joins its main stream. After Yulu, it follows
the left bank of the Sanpo River passing by Kongposaga
to Timchao. From Timchao, the line turns
away from the Sanpo River and proceeds in an
eastward direction to Timchong city, Ikung, Kuba, and
Shuachong. After Shuachong, the line proceeds southeastward
to Lima, thence eastward to Menkong on the
Lukiang. From Menkong, the line turns southward
and goes along the right bank of the Lukiang passing
Samotung to Tantau. Then crossing the Lukiang, it
proceeds across the watershed through Gaiwa village
to the Lantsang (or Mekong) River, and to Hsiaoweisi
beyond it. After Hsiaoweisi, it follows the river
bank to the Chenghsin Copper Mine, thence it turns
away from the river and proceeds by Hosi, Erhyuan,
Tengchow, and Shangkwang to Tali. From Tali, the
line proceeds to Hsiakwang, Fengyi, Menghwa, and
then meets the Lantsang River again at Paotien.
Thence it follows the left bank southward right through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
to Cheli, where it ends. This line covers a distance
of 900 miles.</p>

<h4>d. The Lhasa-Taklongshong Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa and proceeds southward
by way of Teking to the Sanpo River where turning
eastward it follows the left bank of the river to Sakorshong.
After crossing the Sanpo River to Chetang, it
proceeds southward by Chikablung, Menchona, Tawang,
Dhirangjong to Taklongshong and continues
farther on until it reaches the Assam frontier. This
line covers a distance of 200 miles.</p>

<h4>e. The Lhasa-Yatung Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa and proceeds southwestward
by Chashih following the former imperial highway
by Yitang and Kiangli to Chushui. At Chushui, it
crosses to Sanpo River over the Mulih Bridge to Chakamo
on the south side, thence to Tamalung, Paiti,
Tabolung, and Nagartse. After Nagartse, the line
turns westward to Jungku, Lhaling, and Shachia. At
Shachia, the line leaves the former imperial highway
and turns southwestward again and proceeds via Kula
to Yatung at the Sikkim border. This line covers a
distance of 250 miles.</p>

<h4>f. The Lhasa-Laichiyaling Line and Branches</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa and proceeds northwestward
by Chashih following the former imperial road
to Little Taking, and westward to Yangpachin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Sangtolohai. Thence turning southwestward, it proceeds
to Namaling and Tangto, and crosses the Sanpo
River at Lhaku. After Lhaku, the line turns westward
to Shigatse, the second important city in Tibet whence
it proceeds in the same direction to Chashihkang, Pangcholing,
and Lhatse all on the right side of the Sanpo
River. From Lhatse, a branch line starts southwestward
via Chayakor and Dingri to Niehlamuh on the
Nepal border. The main line, however, crosses to the
left side of the Sanpo River and proceeds on the same
highway via Nabringtaka to Tadum where another
branch line proceeds southwestward to the Nepal
border. The main line continues northwestward via
Tamusa and Choshan to Gartok, thence turning westward
it proceeds to Laichiyaling on the Sutlej River
and ends on the Indian border. This line, including the
two branches, covers a distance of 850 miles.</p>

<h4>g. The Lhasa-Nohho Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa and runs in the same
track as line (f) to Sangtolohai where it proceeds by
its own line northwestward to Teching, Sangchashong,
and Taktung. Thence, it enters into the richest gold
field in Tibet and through Wengpo, Tulakpa, Kwangkwei,
and Ikar reaches Nohho, where the line ends. It
covers a distance of 700 miles.</p>

<h4>h. The Lhasa-Iden Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lhasa, following the common
track of lines (f) and (g) to the southwestern corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of Tengri Lake, whence it proceeds by its own track
northwestward by Lungmajing, Tipoktolo and four or
five other small places to Sari. After Sari, the line
penetrates a vast tract of uninhabited land to Pakar
and Suketi. Thence crossing the mountain passes and
descending from the highland to the Tarim Basin
through Sorkek to Yasulakun, the line joins the Cherchen-Iden
railway of the Northwestern System and
proceeds on the same track to Iden. This line covers
a distance of 700 miles.</p>

<h4>i. The Lanchow-Chochiang Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Lanchow, on the same track of
the Lhasa-Lanchow line as far as the southeastern
corner of the Lake Kokonor. Thence it proceeds on its
own track by skirting along the southern shore of Lake
Kokonor to Dulankit, where it turns southwestward to
Dzunsasak. From Dzunsasak, the line proceeds in a
westerly course along the southern side of the Zaidam
Swamp, and passes Tunyueh, Halori, and Golmot to
Hatikair. After Hatikair, the line turns northwestward
by Baipa, Nolinjoha, to Orsinte. Thence turning
more northward, it proceeds across the mountain range
by Tsesinvitusuik and Tuntunomik to Chochiang,
where it ends by joining the Ansi-Iden and Chochiang-Koria
lines, covering a distance of 700 miles.</p>

<h4>j. The Chengtu-Dzunsasak Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Chengtu and proceeds to Kwanhsien
on the track of the Lhasa-Chengtu line, thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
northward on its own track by Wenchuan, to Mauchow.
Then, it proceeds northwestward following the course
of the Minkiang to Sungpan. After Sungpan, it ascends
the Min Valley passing Tungpi to Shangleyao,
where it crosses the watershed from the Yangtze River
side to that of the Hoangho. Thence the line proceeds
to Orguseri, and following a branch of the Hoangho
to the northwestern turn of its main stream, it proceeds
along its right bank via Chahuntsin to Peilelachabu.
There it crosses the Hoangho to the northwest turn of
the old imperial road, where it joins the Lhasa-Lanchow
line and proceeds as far as Lanipar. Then
turning northwestward, it proceeds by its own line to
Dzunsasak, where it ends by joining the Lanchow-Chochiang
line. This line covers a distance of 650
miles.</p>

<h4>k. The Ningyuan-Cherchen Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Ningyuan and proceeds in a
northwestward direction via Hwaiyuanchen to the
Yalungkiang. Then it ascends along the left side of
that river to Yakiang, and crossing to the right side
of that river it proceeds by the old post road to Siolo,
where it turns away from the river and follows the
same post road to Litang. From Litang it proceeds
in the same direction but follows another road to
Kangtu, on the left side of the Kinshakiang. Following
the same side of the river, it proceeds to Sawusantusze,
where it crosses the Lhasa-Chengtu line. After
Sawusantusze, the line continues in the same direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
and follows the same side of the Kinshakiang via Tashigompa,
to the Huhusair Bridge, where it crosses the
Lhasa-Lanchow line. Then following a northern
branch of the Kinshakiang to its source and crossing
the watershed, it proceeds along the caravan road by
Hsinszukiang and Olokung to Cherchen, where it ends,
covering a distance of about 1,350 miles. This is the
longest line of this system.</p>

<h4>l. The Chengtu-Menkong Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Chengtu and proceeds southwestward
by Shuangliu, Hsintsin, Mingshan, to Yachow.
From Yachow, it turns northwestward and
proceeds to Tienchuan, then westward to Tatsienlu,
Tunyolo, and Litang. After Litang, the line proceeds
southwestward through Batang and Yakalo, to Menkong,
covering a distance of about 400 miles of very
mountainous country.</p>

<h4>m. The Chengtu-Yuankiang Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Chengtu on the same track of
the Chengtu-Menkong line, proceeds to Yachow and
thence by its own track in the same direction via Jungching,
to Tsingliu. After Tsingliu, the line proceeds
southward through Yuehsi to Ningyuan, where it
meets the head of the Ningyuan-Cherchen line. After
Ningyuan, it goes to Kwaili, then crosses the Kinshakiang
to Yunnanfu where it crosses the Canton-Tali
line. From Yunnanfu, it proceeds along the west side
of the Kunming Lake to Kunyang, and through Hsinshing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Hsingo, to Yuankiang, where the line ends by
joining the Canton-Szemo line. It covers a distance of
about 600 miles.</p>

<h4>n. The Suifu-Tali Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Suifu and proceeds along the
left bank of the Yangtze River to Pingshan and Lupo.
After Lupo, it turns away from the river in a southwesterly
direction and scales the Taliangshan
Mountains to Ningyuan, where it crosses the Chengtu-Yuankiang
line and meets the termini of the Canton-Ningyuan
line and the Ningyuan-Cherchen line.
Thence continuing in the same direction, it crosses the
Yalungkiang to Yenyuan and Yungpeh. After Yungpeh,
the line turns more southward, across the Kinshakiang
to Sincheng and thence to Tali, where it ends
by meeting the Canton-Tali line and the Lhasa-Tali
line. It covers a distance of about 400 miles.</p>

<h4>o. The Suifu-Mengting Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Suifu on the same track as the
Suifu-Tali line as far as Lupo. From Lupo, it goes
on its own track across the Yangtze River here known
as the Kinshakiang, and follows the right side of that
river upward to its southward bend where it crosses the
Chengtu-Yuankiang line, to Yuanmow. From Yuanmow,
it proceeds to Tsuyung, where it crosses the
Canton-Tali line, thence to Kingtung. After Kingtung,
it proceeds southwestward across the Lantsangkiang
or Mekong River, to Yunchow, thence turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
southwestward, it follows a branch of the Lukiang
River to Mengting and ends on the frontier. This line
covers a distance of about 500 miles.</p>

<h4>p. The Iden-Gartok Line</h4>

<p>This line starts from Iden, and proceeds southward
along the Keriya River to Polu, thence following the
caravan road up the highland to Kuluk. From Kuluk,
it proceeds southwestward via Alasa and Tunglong to
Nohho, where it meets the terminus of the Lhasa-Nohho
line. After Nohho, it skirts around the eastern
end of the Noh-tso-Lake to Rudok and proceeds southwestward
to Demchok, on the Indus River. From
Demchok, it proceeds southeastward following the
Indus River up to Gartok, where it ends by joining the
Lhasa-Laichiyaling line. This line covers a distance of
about 500 miles. This highland system totals about
11,000 miles.</p>

<h3>PART VI<br />

<span class="subhead">The Establishment of Locomotive and Car Factories</span></h3>

<p>The railways projected in the Fourth Program will
total about 62,000 miles; and those in the First and the
Third Programs about 14,000 miles. Besides these,
there will be double tracks in the various trunk lines,
which will make up a grand total of no less than
100,000 miles, as stated in the preliminary part of these
programs. With this 100,000 miles of railways to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
constructed in the coming ten years, the demands for
locomotives and cars will be tremendous. The factories
of the world will be unable to supply them,
especially at this juncture of reconstruction after the
great world war. So the establishment of locomotive
and car factories in China to supply our own demands
of railway equipment will be a necessary as well as a
profitable undertaking. China possesses unlimited supplies
of raw materials and cheap labor. What we need
for establishing such factories is foreign capital and experts.
What amount of capital should be invested in
this project, I have to leave to experts to decide.</p>

<p>I suggest that four large factories should be started
simultaneously at the beginning&mdash;two on the coast and
two on the Yangtze. Of those on the coast, one should
be at the Great Northern Port, and the other at the
Great Southern Port&mdash;Canton. Of those on the
Yangtze, one should be at Nanking and the other at
Hankow. All four are in centers of both land and
water communication, where skilled labor can easily
be obtained. They are also near our iron and coal
fields. Besides these four great factories, others should
be established at suitable centers of iron and coal fields
when our railways will be more developed.</p>

<p>All the factories should be under one central control.
The locomotives and cars of our future railways should
be standardized so as to make possible the interchange
of parts of machinery and equipment. We should also
adopt the standard gauge, that is, the 4 feet 8½ inch
gauge which has been adopted by most of the railways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
of the world. In fact, almost all the railways hitherto
built in China are of this gauge. The purpose of the
proposed standardization is to secure the highest efficiency
as well as the greatest economy.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PROGRAM_V" id="PROGRAM_V">PROGRAM V</a></h2>

<p>In the preceding four programs, I dealt exclusively
with the development of the key and basic industries.
In this one, I am going to deal with the development of
the <i>main</i> group of industries which need foreign help.
By the main group of industries, I mean those industries
which provide every individual and family
with the necessaries and comforts of life. Of course,
when the key and basic industries are developed, the
various other industries will spontaneously spring up
all over the country, in a very short time. This had
been the case in Europe and America after the industrial
revolution. The development of the key and the
basic industries will give plenty of work to the people
and will raise their wages as well as their standard of
living. When wages are high, the price for necessaries
and comforts of life will also be increased. So
the rise in wages will be accompanied by the rise in the
cost of living. Therefore, the aim of the development
of some of the main group of industries is to help
reduce the high cost of living when China is in the
process of international development, by giving to the
majority of the people plenty of the essentials and
comforts of life as well as higher wages.</p>

<p>It is commonly thought that China is the cheapest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
country to live in. This is a misconception owing to
the common notion of measuring everything by the
value of money. If we measure the cost of living by
the value of labor then it will be found that China is
the most expensive country for a common worker to live
in. A Chinese coolie, a muscular worker, has to work
14 to 16 hours a day in order to earn a bare subsistence.
A clerk in a shop, or a teacher in a village school cannot
earn more than a hundred dollars a year. And the
farmers after paying their rents and exchanging for a
few articles of need with their produce have to live from
hand to mouth. Labor is very cheap and plentiful but
food and commodities of life are just enough to go
round for the great multitude of the four hundred
millions in China in an ordinary good year. In a bad
year, a great number succumb to want and starvation.
This miserable condition among the Chinese proletariat
is due to the non-development of the country, the crude
methods of production and the wastefulness of labor.
The radical cure for all this is industrial development
by foreign capital and experts for the benefit of the
whole nation. Europe and America are a hundred
years ahead of us in industrial development; so in
order to catch up in a very short time we have to use
their capital, mainly their machinery. If foreign
capital cannot be gotten, we will have to get at least
their experts and inventors to make for us our own
machinery. In any case, we must use machinery to
assist our enormous man-power to develop our unlimited
resources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
In modern civilization, the material essentials of life
are five, namely: food, clothing, shelter, means of locomotion,
and the printed page. Accordingly I will
formulate this program as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><blockquote class="rmn">
<p><span class="rmn-i">I.</span> The Food Industry.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-ii">II.</span> The Clothing Industry.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-iii">III.</span> The Housing Industry.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-iv">IV.</span> The Motoring Industry.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-v">V.</span> The Printing Industry.</p>
</blockquote></div>

<h3>PART I<br />

<span class="subhead">The Food Industry</span></h3>

<p>The food industry should be treated under the following
headings:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Production of Food.</li>
<li>b. The Storage and Transportation of Food.</li>
<li>c. The Preparation and Preservation of Food.</li>
<li>d. The Distribution and Exportation of Food.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Production of Food</h4>

<p>Human foods are derived from three sources: the
land, the sea and the air. By far the most important
and greatest in quantity consumed is aerial food of
which oxygen is the most vital element. But this
aerial food is abundantly provided by nature, and no
human labor is needed for its production except that
which is occasionally needed for the airman and the
submariner. So this food is free to all. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
necessary for us to discuss it here. The production of
food from the sea which I have already touched upon
when I dealt with the construction of fishing harbors
and the building of fishing crafts, will also be left out
here. It is the specific industries in the production of
food from land, which need foreign help that are to be
discussed here.</p>

<p>China is an agricultural country. About four-fifths
of its population is occupied in the work of producing
food. The Chinese farmer is very skillful in intensive
cultivation. He can make the land yield to its utmost
capacity. But vast tracts of arable lands are lying
waste in thickly populated districts for one cause or
other. Some are due to lack of water, some to too
much of it and some to the "dog in the manger"
system,&mdash;the holding up of arable land by speculators
and land sharks for higher rents and prices.</p>

<p>The land of the eighteen provinces alone is at present
supporting a population of four hundred millions. Yet
there is still room for development which can make
this same area of land yield more food if the waste
land be brought under cultivation, and the already
cultivated land be improved by modern machinery and
scientific methods. The farmers must be protected
and encouraged by liberal land laws by which they can
duly reap the fruits of their own labor.</p>

<p>In regard to the production of food in our international
development scheme, two necessary undertakings
should be carried out which will be profitable at the
same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) A scientific survey of the land.</p>

<p>(2) The establishment of factories for manufacturing
agricultural machinery and implements.</p></blockquote>

<p>(1) A scientific survey of the land. China has
never been scientifically surveyed and mapped out. The
administration of land is in the most chaotic state and
the taxation of land is in great confusion, thus causing
great hardships on the poor peasants and farmers. So,
under any circumstance, the survey of land is the first
duty of the government to execute. But this could not
be done without foreign help, owing to lack of funds
and experts. Therefore, I suggest that this work be
taken up by an international organization. This
organization should provide the expenses of the work
by a loan, and should carry out the work with the required
number of experts and equipment. How much
will be the expenses for the survey and what is the
amount of time required and how large an organization
is sufficient to carry on the work, and whether
aerial survey by aeroplanes be practical for this work
are questions which I shall leave to experts to decide.</p>

<p>When the topographical survey is going on a geological
survey may be carried out at the same time so as to
economize expenses. When the survey work is done
and the land of each province is minutely mapped out,
we shall be able to readjust the taxation of the already
cultivated and improved land. As regards the waste
and uncultivated lands we shall be able to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
whether they are suitable for agriculture, for pasture,
for forestry, or for mining. In this way, we can estimate
their value and lease them out to the users for
whatever production that is most suitable. The surplus
tax of the cultivated land and the proceeds of
waste land will be for the payment of the interest and
principal of the foreign loan. Besides the eighteen
provinces, we have a vast extent of agricultural and
pastural lands in Manchuria, Mongolia, and Sinkiang,
and a vast extent of pastural land in Tibet and
Kokonor. They will have to be developed by extensive
cultivation under the colonization scheme, which is
alluded to in the first program.</p>

<p>(2) The establishment of factories for manufacturing
agricultural machinery and implements. When
the waste land is reclaimed, cultivated land improved
and waste labor set to work on the land, the demands
for agricultural machinery and implements will be very
great. As we have cheap labor and plenty of iron and
coal, it is better and cheaper for us to manufacture
than to import the implements and machinery. For
this purpose, much capital should be invested, and
factories should be put up in industrial centers or in
the neighborhood of iron and coal fields, where labor
and material could be easily found.</p>

<h4>b. The Storage and Transportation of Food</h4>

<p>The most important foodstuff to be stored and transported
is grain. Under the present Chinese method,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the storage of grain is most wasteful for if kept in
large quantities it is often destroyed by insects or
damaged by weather. It is only in small quantities and
by great and constant care that grains can be preserved
for a certain period of time. And the transportation
of grains is also most expensive for the work is mostly
done on man's shoulders. When the grains reach the
waterway it is carried in a most makeshift way, without
the least semblance of system. If the method of
storing and transporting of grain be improved, a great
economic saving could be accomplished. I propose
that a chain of grain elevators be built all over the
country and a special transport fleet be equipped all
along the waterways by this International Development
Organization. What will be the capital for this project
and where the elevators should be situated have yet
to be investigated by experts.</p>

<h4>c. The Preparation and Preservation of Food</h4>

<p>Hitherto the preparation of food is entirely by hand
with a few primitive implements. The preservation of
food is either by salt or sun heat. Mills and cannery
method are scarcely known. I suggest that a system of
rice mills should be constructed in all the large cities
and towns in the Yangtze Valley and South China
where rice is the staple food. Flour mills should be
put up in all large cities and towns north of the Yangtze
Valley, where wheat, oats, and cereals other than rice
are the staple food. All these mills should be under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
one central management so as to produce the best
economic results. What amount of capital should be
invested in this mill system by this international development
scheme should be subjected to detailed investigation.</p>

<p>In regard to the preservation of food, fruits, meats
and fishes should be preserved by canning or by refrigeration.
If the canning industry is developed there
will be created a great demand for tinplates. Therefore
the establishment of tinplate factories will be
necessary and also profitable. Such factories should
be situated near the iron and tin fields. There are
many localities in South China where tin, iron, and coal
are situated near each other, thus providing ready
materials for the factories. The tinplate factories and
the canneries should be combined into one enterprise so
as to secure best economic results.</p>

<h4>d. The Distribution and Exportation of Food</h4>

<p>In ordinary good years, China never lacks food.
There is a common saying in China that "One year's
tilling will provide three years' wants." In the richer
sections of the country, the people generally reserve
three or four years' food supply in order to combat a
bad year. But when China is developed and organized
as an economic whole, one year's food reserve should
be kept in the country for the use of the local people
and the surplus should be sent out to the industrial
centers. As the storage and transportation of food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
will be under a central management so the distribution
and exportation of food should be under the same
charge. All surplus grains of a country district should
be sent to the nearest town for storage and each town
or city should store one year's food. All the staple
food should be sold only at cost price to the inhabitants
according to their number, by the distributing
department. And the surplus food should be exported
to foreign countries where it is wanted and where the
highest price can be obtained by the export department
under the central management. Thus the surplus food
will not be wasted as hitherto under the prohibition
law. The proceeds of this export will surely amount
to a huge sum which will be used in the payment of
the interest and principal of the foreign loan invested
in this undertaking.</p>

<p>We cannot complete this part of the food industry
without giving special consideration to the Tea and
Soya industries. The former, as a beverage, is well
known throughout and used by the civilized world and
the latter is just beginning to be realized as an important
foodstuff by the scientists and food administrators.
Tea, the most healthy and delicious beverage of
mankind, is produced in China. Its cultivation and
preparation form one of the most important industries
of the country. Once China was the only country that
supplied the world with tea. Now, China's tea trade
has been wrested away from her by India and Japan.
But the quality of the Chinese tea is still unequalled.
The Indian tea contains too much tannic acid, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Japanese tea lacks the flavor which the Chinese tea
possesses. The best tea is only obtainable in China&mdash;the
native land of tea. China lost her tea trade owing
to the high cost of its production. The high cost of
production is caused by the inland tax as well as the
export duty and by the old methods of cultivation and
preparation. If the tax and duty are done away with
and new methods introduced, China can recover her
former position in this trade easily. In this International
Development Scheme, I suggest that a system
of modern factories for the preparation of tea should
be established in all the tea districts, so that the tea
should be prepared by machinery instead of, as hitherto,
by hand. Thus the cost of production can be greatly
reduced and the quality improved. As the world's
demand for tea is daily increasing and will be more so
by a dry United States of America, a project to supply
cheaper and better tea will surely be a profitable one.</p>

<p>Soya bean as a meat substitute was discovered by the
Chinese and used by the Chinese and the Japanese as
a staple food for many thousands of years. As meat
shortage has been keenly felt in carnivorous countries
at present, a solution must be found to relieve it. For
this reason I suggest that in this International Development
Scheme we should introduce this artificial meat,
milk, butter and cheese to Europe and America, by
establishing a system of soya bean factories in all the
large cities of those countries, so as to provide cheap
nitrogenous food to the western people. Modern factories
should also be established in China to replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
those old and expensive methods of production by hand,
so as to procure better economic results as well as to
produce better commodities.</p>

<h3>PART II<br />

<span class="subhead">The Clothing Industry</span></h3>

<p>The principal materials for clothes are silk, linen,
cotton, wool and animal skins. I shall accordingly
deal with them under the following headings:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Silk Industry.</li>
<li>b. The Linen Industry.</li>
<li>c. The Cotton Industry.</li>
<li>d. The Woolen Industry.</li>
<li>e. The Leather Industry.</li>
<li>f. The Manufacturing of Clothing Machinery.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Silk Industry</h4>

<p>Silk is a Chinese discovery and was used as a material
for clothes for many thousands of years before the
Christian Era. It is one of the important national
industries of China. Up to recent times, China was
the only country that supplied silk to the world. But
now this dominant trade has been taken away from
China by Japan, Italy and France, because those
countries have adopted scientific methods for silk
culture and manufacture, while China still uses the
same old methods of many thousand years ago. As
the world's demand for silk is increasing daily, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
improvement of the culture and manufacture of silk
will be a very profitable undertaking. In this International
Development Scheme, I suggest first that scientific
bureaus be established in every silk district to
give directions to the farmers and to provide healthy
silk-worm eggs. These bureaus should be under
central control. At the same time, they will act as
collecting stations for cocoons so as to secure a fair
price for the farmers. Secondly, silk filiatures with
up-to-date machinery should be established in suitable
districts to reel the silk for home as well as for foreign
consumption. And lastly, modern factories should be
put up for manufacturing silk for both home and
foreign markets. All silk filiatures and factories
should be under a single national control and will be
financed with foreign capital and supervised by experts
to secure the best economic results and to produce
better and cheaper commodities.</p>

<h4>b. The Linen Industry</h4>

<p>This is an old Chinese industry. In southern China
there is produced a kind of very fine linen in the form
of ramie, known as China-grass. This fiber if treated
by modern methods and machinery becomes almost as
fine and glossy as silk. But in China, so far as I know,
there is not yet such new method and machinery for
the manufacturing of this linen. The famous Chinese
grass-cloth is manufactured by the old method of hand-looms.
I propose that new methods and machinery
be introduced into China by this International Development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Organization to manufacture this linen. A
system of modern factories should be established all
over the ramie-producing districts in South China
where raw materials and labor are obtainable.</p>

<h4>c. The Cotton Industry</h4>

<p>Cotton is a foreign product which was introduced
into China centuries ago. It became a very important
Chinese industry during the hand-loom age. But after
the import of foreign cotton goods into China, this
native handicraft industry was gradually killed by the
foreign trade. So, great quantities of raw cotton are
exported and finished cotton goods are imported in
large quantities into China. What an anomaly when
we consider the enormous, cheap labor in China.
However a few cotton mills have been started recently
in treaty ports which have made enormous profits. It
is reported that during the last two or three years most
of the Shanghai cotton mills declared a dividend of
100 per cent and some even 200 per cent! The demand
for cotton goods in China is very great but the supply
falls short. It is necessary to put up more mills in
China for cotton manufacturing. Therefore, I suggest
in this International Development Scheme to put up
a system of large cotton mills all over the cotton-producing
districts under one central national control.
Thus the best economic results will be obtained and
cotton goods can be supplied to the people at a lower
cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<h4>d. The Woolen Industry</h4>

<p>Although the whole of Northwestern China&mdash;about
two-thirds of the entire country is a pastural land yet
the woolen industry has never been developed. Every
year, plenty of raw materials are exported from China
on the one hand and plenty of finished woolen goods
imported on the other. Judging by the import and
export of the woolen trade the development of woolen
industry in China will surely be a profitable business.
I suggest that scientific methods be applied to the raising
of sheep and to the treatment of wool so as to
improve the quality and increase the quantity. Modern
factories should be established all over northwestern
China for manufacturing all kinds of finished woolen
goods. Here we have the raw materials, cheap labor
and unlimited market. What we want for the development
of this industry is foreign capital and experts.
This will be one of the most remunerative projects in
our International Development Scheme, for the industry
will be a new one and there will be no private
competitors on the field.</p>

<h4>e. The Leather Industry</h4>

<p>This will also be a new industry in China, despite
the fact that there are a few tanneries in the treaty
ports. The export of hides from and the import of
leather goods into China are increasing every year. So,
to establish a system of tanneries and factories for
leather goods and foot-gear will be a lucrative undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<h4>f. The Manufacturing of Clothing Machinery</h4>

<p>The machinery for the manufacturing of various
kinds of clothing materials is in great demand in China.
It is reported that the orders for cotton mill machinery
have been filled up for the next three years from manufacturers
in Europe and America. If China is developed
according to my programs, the demand for machinery
will be many times greater than at present and
the supply in Europe and America will be too short
to meet it. Therefore to establish factories for the
manufacturing of clothing machinery is a necessary as
well as a profitable undertaking. Such factories should
be established in the neighborhood of iron and steel
factories, so as to save expenses for transportation of
heavy materials. What will be the capital for this
undertaking should be decided by experts.</p>

<h3>PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">The Housing Industry</span></h3>

<p>Among the four hundred millions in China the poor
still live in huts and hovels, and in caves in the loess
region of north China while the middle and the rich
classes live in temples. All the so-called houses in
China, excepting a few after western style and those
in treaty ports are built after the model of a temple.
When a Chinese builds a house he has more regard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the dead than for the living. The first consideration of
the owner is his ancestral shrine. This must be placed
at the center of the house, and all the other parts must
be complement and secondary to it. The house is
planned not for comfort but for ceremonies, that is,
for "the red and white affairs," as they are called in
China. The "red affair" is the marriage or other
felicitous celebrations of any member of the family,
and the "white affair" is the funeral ceremonies.
Besides the ancestral shrine there are the shrines of the
various household gods. All these are of more importance
than man and must be considered before him.
There is not a home in old China that is planned for
the comfort and convenience of man alone. So now
when we plan the housing industry in China in our
International Development Scheme, we must take the
houses of the entire population of China into consideration.
"To build houses for four hundred millions, it
is impossible!" some may exclaim. This is the largest
job ever conceived by man. But if China is going to
give up her foolish traditions and useless habits and
customs of the last three thousand years and begin to
adopt modern civilization, as our industrial development
scheme is going to introduce, the remodelling of
all the houses according to modern comforts and conveniences
is bound to come, either unconsciously by
social evolution or consciously by artificial construction.
The modern civilization so far attained by
western nations is entirely an unconscious progress, for
social and economic sciences are but recent discoveries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
But henceforth all human progress will be more or
less based upon knowledge, that is upon scientific planning.
As we can foresee now, within half a century
under our industrial development, the houses of all
China will be renewed according to modern comfort
and convenience. Is it not far better and cheaper to
rebuild the houses of all China by a preconceived
scientific plan than by none? I have no doubt that if
we plan to build a thousand houses at one time it would
be ten times cheaper than to plan and build one at a
time, and the more we build the cheaper terms we
would get. This is a positive economic law. The only
danger in this is over-production. That is the only
obstacle for all production on a large scale. Since the
industrial revolution in Europe and America, every
financial panic before the world war was caused by
over-production. In the case of our housing industry
in China, there are four hundred million customers.
At least fifty million houses will be needed in the coming
fifty years. Thus a million houses a year will be
the normal demand of the country.</p>

<p>Houses are a great factor in civilization. They give
men more enjoyment and happiness than food and
clothes. More than half of the human industries are
contributing to household needs. The housing industry
will be the greatest undertaking of our International
Development Scheme, and also will be the most
profitable part of it. My object of the development of
the housing industry is to provide cheap houses to the
masses. A ten thousand dollar house now built in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
treaty port can be produced for less than a thousand
dollars and yet a high margin of profit can be made.
In order to accomplish this we have to produce transport,
and distribute the materials for construction.
After the house is finished, all household equipment
must be furnished. Both of these will be comprised in
the housing industry which I shall formulate as
follows:</p>

<div class="center"><ul><li>a. The Production and Transportation of Building Materials.</li>
<li>b. The Construction of Houses.</li>
<li>c. The Manufacturing of Furniture.</li>
<li>d. The Supply of Household Utilities.</li></ul></div>

<h4>a. The Production and Transportation of Building Materials</h4>

<p>The building materials are bricks, tiles, timber, skeleton
iron, stone, cement and mortar. Each of these
materials must be manufactured or cut out from raw
materials. So kilns for the manufacture of tiles and
bricks must be put up. Mills for timbers must be
established, also factories for skeleton irons. Quarries
must be opened and factories for cement and mortar
must be started. All these establishments must be put
up at suitable districts where materials and markets are
near one another. All should be under one central
control so as to regulate the output of each of these
materials in proportion to the demand. After the
materials are ready they must be transported to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
places where they are wanted by special bottoms on
waterways, and by special cars on railways so as to
reduce the cost as low as possible. For this purpose
special boats and cars must be built by the shipbuilding
department and the car factory.</p>

<h4>b. The Construction of Houses</h4>

<p>The houses to be built in China will comprise public
buildings and private residences. As the public buildings
are to be built with public funds for public uses
which will not be a profitable undertaking, a special
Government Department should therefore be created
to take charge. The houses that are to be built under
this International Development Scheme will be private
residences only with the object to provide cheap houses
for the people, as well as to make profit for this International
concern. The houses will be built on standardized
types. In cities and towns the houses should be
constructed on two lines: the single family and the
group family houses. The former should again be
sub-divided into eight-roomed, ten-roomed and twelve-roomed
houses, and the latter into ten-family, hundred-family
and thousand-family houses, with four or six
rooms for each family. In the country districts the
houses should be classified according to the occupation
of the people, and special annexes such as barns and
dairies should be provided for the farmers. All houses
should be designed and built according to the needs
and comfort of man; so a special architectural department
should be established to study the habits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
occupations and needs of different people and make
improvements from time to time. The construction
should be performed as much as possible by labor-saving
machinery so as to accelerate work and save
expenses.</p>

<h4>c. The Manufacturing of Furniture</h4>

<p>As all houses in China should be remodelled all
furniture should be replaced by up-to-date ones, which
are made for the comforts and needs of man. Furniture
of the following kinds should be manufactured:
the library, the parlor, the bedroom, the kitchen, the
bathroom and the toilet. Each kind should be manufactured
in a special factory under the management of
the International Development Organization.</p>

<h4>d. The Supply of Household Utilities</h4>

<p>The household utilities are water, light, heat, fuel and
telephones. Except in treaty ports, there is no water-supply
system in any of the cities and towns of China.
Even many treaty ports possess none as yet. In all the
large cities, the people obtain their water from rivers
which at the same time act as sewage. The water
supply of the large cities and towns in China is most
unsanitary, (1) It is an urgent necessity that water
supply systems should be installed in all cities and towns
in China without delay. Therefore special factories
for equipping the water system should be established
in order to meet the needs. (2) Lighting plants should
be installed in all the cities and towns in China. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
factories for the manufacture of the machinery lighting
plants should be established. (3) Modern heating
plants should be installed in every household, using
either electricity, gas, or steam. So the manufacturing
of heating equipment is a necessity. Factories should
be established for this purpose. (4) Cooking fuel is
one of the most costly items in the daily needs of the
Chinese people. In the country the people generally
devote ten per pent of their working time to gathering
firewoods. In town the people spend about twenty per
cent of their living expenses for firewood alone. Thus
this firewood question accumulates into a great national
waste. The firewood and grass as a cooking fuel
must be substituted by coal in the country districts, and
by gas or electricity in towns and cities. In order to
use coal gas and electricity, proper equipment must
be provided. So factories for the manufacturing of
coal gas, and electricity, stoves for every family must
be established by this International Development Organization.
(5) Telephones must also be supplied to
every family in the cities as well as in the country. So
factories for manufacturing the equipment must be
put up in China, in order to render them as cheap as
possible.</p>

<h3>PART IV<br />

<span class="subhead">The Motoring Industry</span></h3>

<p>The Chinese are a stagnant race. From time immemorial
a man is praised for staying at home and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
caring for his immediate surroundings only. Laotse&mdash;a
contemporary of Confucius&mdash;says: "The good
people are those who live in countries so near to each
other that they can hear each other's cock crow and
dog bark and yet they never have had intercourse with
each other during their lifetime." This is often quoted
as the Golden Age of the Chinese people. But in modern
civilization the condition is entirely changed.
Moving about occupies a great part of a man's life
time. It is the movement of man that makes civilization
progress. China, in order to catch up with modern
civilization, must move. And the movement of the
individual forms an important part of the national
activity. A man must move whenever and wherever
he pleases with ease and rapidity. However, China,
at present, lacks the means of facility for individual
movement, for all the old great highways were ruined
and have disappeared, and the automobile has not yet
been introduced into the interior of the country. The
motor car, a recent invention, is a necessity for rapid
movement. If we wish to move quickly and do more
work, we must adopt the motor car as a vehicle. But
before we can use the motor car, we have to build our
roads. In the preliminary part of this International
Development Scheme, I proposed to construct one million
miles of roads. These should be apportioned
according to the ratio of population in each district for
construction. In the eighteen provinces of China
Proper, there are nearly 2,000 hsiens. If all parts of
China are to adopt the hsien administration, there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
be nearly 4,000 hsiens in all. Thus the construction
of roads for each hsien will be on an average of 250
miles. But some of the hsiens have more people and
some have less. If we divide the million miles of
roads by the four hundred million people, we shall have
one mile to every four hundred. For four hundred
people to build one mile of road is not a very difficult
task to accomplish. If my scheme of making road-building
as a condition for granting local autonomy is
adopted by the nation, we shall see one million miles of
road built in a very short time as if by a magic
wand.</p>

<p>As soon as the people of China decide to build roads,
this International Development Organization can begin
to put up factories for manufacturing motor cars.
First start on a small scale and gradually expand the
plants to build more and more until they are sufficient
to supply the needs of the four hundred million people.
The cars should be manufactured to suit different purposes,
such as the farmer's car, the artisan's car, the
business man's car, the tourist's car, the truck car, etc.
All these cars, if turned out on a large scale, can be
made much cheaper than at present, so that everybody
who wishes it, may have one.</p>

<p>Besides supplying cheap cars, we must also supply
cheap fuel, otherwise the people will still be unable to
use them. So the development of the oil fields in
China should follow the motor car industry. This
will be dealt with in more detail under the mining
industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<h3>PART V<br />

<span class="subhead">The Printing Industry</span></h3>

<p>This industry provides man with intellectual food.
It is a necessity of modern society, without which mankind
cannot progress. All human activities are
recorded, and all human knowledge is stored in printing.
It is a great factor of civilization. The progress
and civilization of different nations of the world are
measured largely by the quantity of printed matter
they turned out annually. China, though the nation
that invented printing, is very backward in the development
of its printing industry. In our International
Development Scheme, the printing industry must also
be given a place. If China is developed industrially
according to the lines which I suggested, the demand
for printed matter by the four hundred millions will
be exceedingly great. In order to meet this demand
efficiently, a system of large printing houses must be
established in all large cities in the country, to undertake
printing of all kinds from newspapers to encyclopædia.
The best modern books on various subjects in different
countries should be translated into Chinese and published
in cheap edition form for the general public in
China. All the publishing houses should be organized
under one common management, so as to secure the
best economic results.</p>

<p>In order to make printed matter cheap, other subsidiary
industries must be developed at the same time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
The most important of these is the paper industry. At
present all the paper used by newspapers in China is
imported. And the demand for paper is increasing
every day. China has plenty of raw materials for making
paper, such as the vast virgin forests of the northwestern
part of the country, and the wild reeds of the
Yangtze and its neighboring swamps which would furnish
the best pulps. So, large plants for manufacturing
papers should be put up in suitable locations. Besides
the paper factories, ink factories, type foundries, printing
machine factories, etc., should be established under
a central management to produce everything that is
needed in the printing industry.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PROGRAM_VI" id="PROGRAM_VI">PROGRAM VI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">The Mining Industry</span></h2>

<p>Mining and farming are the two most important
means of producing raw materials for industries. As
farming is to produce food for man, so mining is to
produce food for machinery. Machinery is the tree
of modern industries, and the mining industry is the
root of machinery. Thus, without the mining industry
there would be no machinery, and without machinery
there would be no modern industries which have revolutionized
the economic conditions of mankind. The
mining industry, after all, is the greatest factor of
material civilization and economic progress. Although
in the fifth part of the first program I suggested the
development of the iron and coal fields in Chili and
Shansi as an auxiliary project for the development of
the Great Northern Port, still, a special program should
be devoted to mining in general. The mineral lands
of China belong to the state, and mining in China is
still in its infancy. So to develop the mining industry
from the outset as a state enterprise would be a sound
economic measure. But mining in general is very risky
and to enlist foreign capital in its development in a
wholesale manner is unadvisable. Therefore, only such
mining projects which are sure to be profitable will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
brought under the International Development Scheme.
I shall formulate this mining program as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><blockquote class="rmn">
<p><span class="rmn-i">I.</span> The Mining of Iron.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-ii">II.</span> The Mining of Coal.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-iii">III.</span> The Mining of Oil.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-iv">IV.</span> The Mining of Copper.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-v">V.</span> The Working of Some Particular Mines.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-vi">VI.</span> The Manufacture of Mining Machinery.</p>
<p><span class="rmn-vii">VII.</span> The Establishment of Smelting Plants.</p>
</blockquote></div>

<h3>PART I<br />

<span class="subhead">The Mining of Iron</span></h3>

<p>Iron is the most important element in modern industries.
Its deposits are found in great quantities
in certain areas and can be easily mined. The iron
mines should be worked absolutely as a state property.
Besides the Chili and Shansi iron mines, the other
iron fields must also be developed. There are very rich
deposits in the southwestern provinces, the Yangtze
Valley and the northwestern provinces in China Proper.
Sinkiang, Mongolia, Manchuria, Kokonor, and Tibet
also possess large deposits of iron. We have the Han
Yeh Ping Iron and Steel Works in the Yangtze Valley
and the Pen Chi Hu Iron and Steel Works in South
Manchuria, both of which are largely capitalized by
Japan and are working very profitably lately. There
should be similar works in the vicinity of Canton, the
Great Southern Port, and also in Szechuen, and Yunnan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
where iron and coal are found side by side. The
iron deposits in Sinkiang, Kansu, Mongolia, etc., must
also be developed one after the other, according to the
needs of the locality. Iron and Steel Works must be
put up in each of these regions to supply the local demand
for manufactured iron. What amount of capital
should be invested in these additional iron and steel
works must be thoroughly investigated by experts. But
I should say that a sum equal to or double the amount
to be invested in the Chili and Shansi iron and steel
works will not be too much, because of the great demand
which will result in the development of China.</p>

<h3>PART II<br />

<span class="subhead">The Mining of Coal</span></h3>

<p>China is known to be the country most rich in coal
deposits, yet her coal fields are scarcely scratched. The
output of coal in the United States is about six hundred
million tons a year. If China is equally developed she
should, according to the proportion of her population,
have an output of four times as much coal as the
United States. This will be the possibility of coal mining
in China which the International Development
Organization is to undertake. As coal deposits are
found in great quantities in certain areas so its output
can be estimated quite accurately beforehand. Thus,
the risk is of no consideration and the profit is sure.
But as coal is a necessity of civilized community and
the sinews of modern industries, the principal object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
for mining should not be for profit alone, but for
supplying the needs of mankind. After the payment
of interest and capital of the foreign loans for its
development, and the securing of high wages for the
miners, the price of coal should be reduced as low as
possible so as to meet the demands of the public as well
as to give impetus to the development of various industries.
I suggest that besides the mining of coal for
the iron and steel works, a plan for producing two
hundred million tons of coal a year for other uses
should be formed at the start. Mines should be
opened along the seaboard and navigable rivers.
As Europe is now seeking coal from China this
amount will not be over-production from the beginning.
A few years later when the industries of China
will be more developed more coal will be needed.
How much capital will be required and what mines are
to be worked, have to be submitted to scientific investigation
under expert direction.</p>

<p>Besides coal mining, the coal products industry
must be developed under the same management. This
is a new industry without any competition and has an
unlimited market in China. Great profits will be
assured on the capital invested.</p>

<h3>PART III<br />

<span class="subhead">The Mining of Oil</span></h3>

<p>It is well-known that the richest company in the
world is the Standard Oil Company of New York, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
that the richest man in the world is Rockefeller, organizer
of this company. This proves that oil mining
is a most profitable business. China is known to be a
very rich oil-bearing country. Oil springs are found
in the provinces of Szechuen, Kansu, Sinkiang, and
Shensi. How vast is the underground reservoir of oil
in China is not yet known. But the already known
oil springs have never been worked and made use of,
while the import of kerosene, gasoline, and crude oil
from abroad is increasing every year. When China
is developed as a motoring country, the use of gasoline
will be increased a thousand-fold, then the supply from
the foreign fields will not be able to meet the demands,
as shortage of oil is already felt in Europe and
America. The mining of oil in China will soon become
a necessity. This enterprise should be taken up
by the International Development Organization for
the state. Production on a large scale should be started
at once. Pipe line systems should be installed between
oil districts and populous and industrial centers in
the interior and also river and sea ports. What amount
of capital should be invested in the project will have
to be investigated by experts.</p>

<h3>PART IV<br />

<span class="subhead">The Mining of Copper</span></h3>

<p>The copper deposits, like iron ores, are found in
great quantities in different places. So the quantity
of ores in each mine can be accurately estimated before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
it is opened and its working generally runs no risk.
Thus, the mining of copper should be taken up as a
government enterprise, as was always the case in China,
and financed and worked by the International Development
Organization. The richest copper deposits in
China are found along the border of Szechuen and
Yunnan on the Yangtze River. The government copper
mine in Chaotung, in the northeastern corner of
Yunnan, has been working for many centuries. Cash,
the standard currency of China, was made mostly of
the copper from Yunnan province. The currency still
absorbs an enormous quantity of copper. Owing to the
difficulty of transporting the Yunnan copper, most of
the metal for currency is being imported from foreign
countries. Besides currency, copper is very commonly
used for many other purposes and when the industries
in China are developed the demand will increase a
hundred times. So the demand for this metal will be
very great in the market of China alone. I suggest that
production on a large scale should be adopted and
modern plants should be installed in copper mines.
How much capital to be invested in this enterprise
should be decided by experts after careful investigation.</p>

<h3>PART V<br />

<span class="subhead">The Working of Some Particular Mines</span></h3>

<p>In regard to the mining of various kinds of metal,
some particular mines should be taken up by the International
Development Organization. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
many famous mines in China which have been worked
for many centuries by hand, such as the Kochui tin
mine in Yunnan, the Moho gold mine in Heilungkiang,
and the Khotan jade mine in Sinkiang. All these mines
are known to have very rich deposits,&mdash;the deeper the
richer. Hitherto only the surface parts of those mines
have been worked and the larger deposits are still untouched,
owing to the lack of means of getting rid of
the water. Some of the mines are still in the hands
of the Government, while others have been given up to
private concerns. If modern machinery is adopted the
mines should revert to the Government so as to secure
economy in working. Many discarded mines of this
kind should be thoroughly investigated, and if found
profitable, work should be resumed under the International
Development Scheme. All future mining, other
than government enterprise, should be leased to private
concerns on contract, and when the term is up, the
government has the option to take them over, if found
profitable as a state property. Thus all profitable
mines will be socialized in time and the profit will be
equally shared by all the people in the country.</p>

<h3>PART VI<br />

<span class="subhead">The Manufacture of Mining Machinery</span></h3>

<p>Most of the metal deposits of the earth are in small
quantities and scattered far and wide in various places.
Most of the mining enterprises resemble farming in that
it is more profitable to work by individuals and small
parties. As such is the case, most of the mining enterprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
have to be worked out by private concerns. In
order to accelerate the development of mining, more
liberal laws should be adopted; education and information
should be given freely by experts employed by the
state; and encouragement and financial assistance
should be given by the state and private banks. The
part that the International Development Organization
should take in general mining enterprises is to manufacture
all kinds of mining tools and machinery, and to
supply them to the miners at low cost, either on cash
or on credit. By distributing tools and machinery to the
surplus workers in China, the mining industry would
be developed by leaps and bounds. And the more the
mining industry is developed the more will be the demand
for tools and machinery. Thus the profits for
the manufacturing concerns would be limitless, so to
speak. Of course, the factories should be started on
a small scale and be extended gradually according to
the ratio of the development of the mining industry.
I suggest that the first factory of this kind should be
established at Canton, the seaport of the southwestern
mining region, where raw materials and skilled labor
can be easily obtained. The other factories should be
established in Hankow and the Great Northern Port
afterwards.</p>

<h3>PART VII<br />

<span class="subhead">The Establishment of Smelting Plants</span></h3>

<p>Smelting plants for various kinds of metals should
be put up in all mining districts to turn ore into metals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
These smelting plants should be conducted under the
coöperative system. At first, a reasonable price should
be paid to the miner when the ore is collected. Afterwards,
when the metal is sold, either at home or in
foreign markets, the smelting works will take a share of
the profit to cover the expenses, the interest, the sinking
fund, etc. The surplus profit should be divided among
the workers according to their wages, and among the
capitalists according to the proportion of ore they contribute
to the furnace. In this way we can encourage
private mining enterprise which forms the root of
other industries. All smelting works should be put up
according to local needs and their scale should be determined
by experts and managed under a central
control.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h2>

<p>In this International Development Scheme, I venture
to present a practical solution for the three great world
questions which are the International War, the Commercial
War and the Class War. As it has been discovered
by post-Darwin philosophers that the primary
force of human evolution is coöperation and not
struggle as that of the animal world, so the fighting
nature, a residue of the animal instinct in man, must
be eliminated from man, the sooner the better.</p>

<p>International war is nothing more than pure and
simple organized robbery on a grand scale, which all
right-minded people deplore. When the United States
of America turned the recent European conflict into
a world war by taking part in it, the American people
to a man determined to make this war end war forever.
And the hope of the peace-loving nations in the world
was raised so high that we Chinese thought that the
"Tatung" or the Great Harmony Age was at hand.
But unfortunately, the United States has completely
failed in peace, in spite of her great success in war.
Thus, the world has been thrown back to the pre-war
condition again. The scrambling for territories, the
struggle for food, and the fighting for raw materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
will begin anew. So instead of disarmament there is
going to be a greater increase in the armies and navies
of the once allied powers for the next war. China, the
most rich and populous country in the world, will be
the prize. Some years ago there was great inclination
among the Powers to divide China and Imperial
Russia actually took steps to colonize Manchuria. But
the then chivalrous Japan went to war with Russia and
thus saved China from partition. Now the militaristic
policy of Japan is to swallow China alone. So long as
China is left to the tender mercy of the militaristic
powers she must either succumb to partition by several
powers or be swallowed up by one power.</p>

<p>However, the tide of the world seems to be turning.
After centuries of sound slumber, the Chinese people
at last are waking up and realizing that we must get
up and follow in the world's progress. Now we are at
the parting of the ways. Shall we organize for war or
shall we organize for peace? Our militarists and reactionaries
desire the former, and they are going to
Japanize China, so that when the time comes they will
start another Boxer Movement once more to defy the
civilized world. But as the founder of the Chung
Hwa Min Kuo&mdash;the Chinese Republic&mdash;I desire to have
China organized for peace. I, therefore, begin to utilize
my pen, which I hope will prove even mightier
than the sword that I used to destroy the Manchu
Dynasty, to write out these programs for organizing
China for peace.</p>

<p>During the course of my writing, these programs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
have been published in various magazines and newspapers
time after time and are being spread all over
China. They are welcomed everywhere and by everyone
in the country. So far there is not a word expressed
in disfavor of my proposition. The only anxiety ever
expressed regarding my scheme is where can we obtain
such huge sums of money to carry out even a small part
of this comprehensive project. Fortunately, however,
soon after the preliminary part of my programs had
been sent out to the different governments and the
Peace Conference, a new Consortium was formed in
Paris for the purpose of assisting China in developing
her natural resources. This was initiated by the American
Government. Thus we need not fear the lack of
capital to start work in our industrial development. If
the Powers are sincere in their motive to coöperate for
mutual benefit, then the military struggle for material
gain in China could eventually be averted. For by
coöperation, they can secure more benefits and advantages
than by struggle. The Japanese militarists still
think that war is the most profitable national pursuit,
and their General Staff keeps on planning a war once
in a decade. This Japanese illusion was encouraged
and strengthened by the campaign of 1894 against
China, a cheap and short one but rich in remuneration
for Japan; also by the campaign of 1904 against Russia
which was a great success to the Japanese, and its
fruit of victory was no less in value; finally by the campaign
of 1914 against Germany which formed her part
in the world war Japan took. Although Japan took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
smallest part in the world war and expended the least
in men and money, yet the fruit of her victory was
Shantung, a territory as large as Roumania before the
war, with a population as numerous as that of France.
With such crowning results in every war during the last
thirty years no wonder the Japanese militarists think
that the most profitable business in this world is War.</p>

<p>The effect of the last war in Europe proves, however,
just the contrary. An aggressive Germany lost entirely
her capital and interests, plus something more, while
victorious France gained practically nothing. Since
China is awake now, the next aggression from Japan
will surely be met by a resolute resistance from the
Chinese people. Even granted that Japan could conquer
China, it would be an impossibility for Japan to
govern China profitably for any period of time. The
Japanese financiers possess better foresight than their
militarists as was proved during the dispute of the
Manchurian and the Mongolian reservations when the
former prevailed over the latter thus causing the Japanese
Government to give up her monopoly of these
territories to the new Consortium, in order to coöperate
with the other powers. We, the Chinese people, who
desire to organize China for peace will welcome heartily
this new Consortium provided it will carry out the
principles which are outlined in these programs. Thus,
coöperation of various nations can be secured and the
military struggle for individual and national gain will
cease forever.</p>

<p>Commercial war, or competition, is a struggle between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
the capitalists themselves. This war has no
national distinction. It is fought just as furiously and
mercilessly between countries as well as within the
country. The method of fighting is to undersell each
other, in order to exhaust the weaker rivals so that the
victor may control the market alone and dictate terms
to the consuming public as long as possible. The result
of the commercial war is no less harmful and cruel to
the vanquished foes than an armed conflict. This war
has become more and more furious every day since the
adoption of machinery for production. It was once
thought by the economists of the Adam Smith school
that competition was a beneficent factor and a sound
economic system, but modern economists discovered
that it is a very wasteful and ruinous system. As a
matter of fact, modern economic tendencies work in a
contrary direction, that is, towards concentration instead
of competition. That is the reason why the trusts
in America flourish in spite of the anti-trust law and
the public opinion which aim at suppressing them. For
trusts, by eliminating waste and cutting down expenses
can produce much cheaper than individual producers.
Whenever a trust enters into a certain field of industry,
it always sweeps that field clean of rivals, by supplying
cheap articles to the public. This would prove a blessing
to the public but for the unfortunate fact that the
trust is a private concern, and its object is to make as
much profit as possible. As soon as all rivals are swept
dean from the field of competition, the trust would
raise the price of its articles as high as possible. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the public is oppressed by it. The trust is a result of
economic evolution, therefore it is out of human power
to suppress it. The proper remedy is to have it owned
by all the people of the country. In my International
Development Scheme, I intend to make all the national
industries of China into a Great Trust owned by the
Chinese people, and financed with international capital
for mutual benefit. Thus once for all, commercial war
will be done away with in the largest market of the
world.</p>

<p>Class war is a struggle between labor and capital.
The war is at present raging at its full height in all the
highly developed industrial countries. Labor feels sure
of its final victory while capitalists are determined to
resist to the bitter end. When will it end and what
will be the decision no one dares to predict. China,
however, owing to the backwardness of her industrial
development, which is a blessing in disguise, in this respect,
has not yet entered into the class war. Our
laboring class, commonly known as coolies, are living
from hand to mouth and will therefore only be too glad
to welcome any capitalist who would even put up a
sweat shop to exploit them. The capitalist is a rare
specimen in China and is only beginning to make his
appearance in the treaty ports.</p>

<p>However, China must develop her industries by all
means. Shall we follow the old path of western civilization?
This old path resembles the sea route of
Columbus' first trip to America. He set out from
Europe by a southwesterly direction through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Canary Islands to San Salvador, in the Bahama Group.
But nowadays navigators take a different direction to
America and find that the destination can be reached
by a distance many times shorter. The path of western
civilization was an unknown one and those who went
before groped in the dark as Columbus did on his first
voyage to America. As a late comer, China can greatly
profit in covering the space by following the direction
already charted by western pioneers. Thus we can foresee
that the final goal of the westward-ho in the Atlantic
is not India but the New World. So is the case in
the economic ocean. The goal of material civilization
is not private profit but public profit. And the shortest
route to it is not competition but coöperation. In my
International Development Scheme, I propose that the
profits of this industrial development should go first
to pay the interest and principal of foreign capital invested
in it; second to give high wages to labor; and
third to improve or extend the machinery of production.
Besides these provisions the rest of the profit I
should go to the public in the form of reduced prices
in all commodities and public services. Thus, all will
enjoy, in the same degree, the fruits of modern
civilization. This industrial development scheme
which is roughly sketched in the above six programs
is a part of my general plan for constructing a New
China. In a nutshell, it is my idea to make capitalism
create socialism in China so that these two economic
forces of human evolution will work side by side in
future civilization.</p>

<p>This Agreement is made at Shanghai on the fourth
day of the seventh month of the second year of the
Republic of China being the fourth day of July, 1913,
and the contracting parties are: The Chinese National
Railway Corporation (hereinafter termed "the Corporation")
duly authorized in virtue of the Presidential
Mandate of the ninth day of the ninth month of the
Republic of China being the ninth day of September,
1912, and in virtue of the Charter of the Corporation
duly promulgated by a Presidential Mandate of the
thirty-first day of the third month of the second year
of the Republic of China being the thirty-first day of
March, 1913, on the one part and Messrs. Pauling
and Company, Limited, of 26 Victoria Street, London,
S.&nbsp;W. (hereinafter termed "the Contractors") on the
other part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now it is Hereby Agreed</span> by and between the
parties hereto as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<h3>ARTICLE I</h3>

<p>The Contractors, or their Assigns, agree to issue
on behalf of the Government of the Republic of China
a sterling Loan, bearing interest at the rate of five per
cent per annum, (hereinafter referred to as "the Loan")
for such an amount as may be mutually estimated to be
necessary for the completion of the Railway from Canton
to Chungking.</p>

<p>The Loan shall be of the date on which the first
series of Bonds are issued and shall be called "The
Chinese National Railways Government five per cent
Gold Loan of 1912 for the Canton Chungking Railway."</p>

<h3>ARTICLE II</h3>

<p>The proceeds of the Loan are designed for the construction
and equipment of the Railway from Canton
to Chungking (hereinafter called "the Railway") and
for all necessary expenditure appertaining thereto as
may be arranged in the Detailed Agreement, referred
to in Article 17.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE III</h3>

<p>The payment of the interest and the redemption of
the Capital of the Loan are guaranteed by the Government
of the Republic of China and by a special lien
upon the Canton Chungking Railway.</p>

<p>This special lien constitutes a first mortgage in
favour of the Contractors, acting on behalf of the
Bondholders, upon the Railway itself, as and when constructed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
and on the revenue of all descriptions derivable
therefrom, and upon all materials, rolling stock
and buildings of every description purchased or to be
purchased for the Railway.</p>

<p>Should there be default in payments on the dates
fixed of all or part of the half yearly interest or amortization
payments, the Contractors shall have the right
to exercise on behalf of the Bondholders all the rights
of action which accrue to them from the special mortgage.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE IV</h3>

<p>During the time of construction of the Railway the
interest on the Bonds and on any advances made by the
Contractors shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Loan. The accruing interest from any proceeds of
the Loan not used during the period of construction,
and the earnings derived by the Corporation from the
working of any sections of the Railway as they are
built, are to be used to make up the amount required for
the payment of the said interest, and if any deficiency
remains it is to be met from the proceeds of the Loan.</p>

<p>When the construction of the Railway is wholly completed,
the interest on the Bonds is to be paid from the
income or earnings of the Railway received by the Corporation,
in such manner and on such dates as may be
provided for in the Detailed Agreement provided for in
Article 17 of this Agreement.</p>

<p>If, at any time, the earnings of the Railway, together
with the funds available from the proceeds of the Loan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
are not sufficient to meet the interest on the Bonds
and the repayment of the capital in accordance with
the Amortization Schedule to be attached to the Detailed
Agreement, the Government of the Republic of
China, in approving of this Agreement, unconditionally
undertakes and promises to pay the principal of the
Loan and the interest of the Loan on the due dates to
be fixed therefor in the Detailed Agreement provided
for in Article 17 of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE V</h3>

<p>The bonds shall be Bonds of the Government of the
Republic of China.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE VI</h3>

<p>The Loan shall be issued to the public in two or more
series of Bonds, the first issue to be made to the amount
of from one to two million pounds sterling as soon as
possible after the signature of the Detailed Agreement
referred to in Article 17 of this Agreement. The issue
price of the Bonds shall be fixed by the Corporation
and the Contractors sometime before the issue, taking
the last price of similar Bonds as a basis for fixing the
market price. The price payable to the Corporation
shall be the actual rate of issue to the public less a sufficient
amount to cover the cost of stamps on the Bonds
in the various countries of issue, provided always that
at least fifty per cent of the Bonds shall be issued in
England, plus floatation charges of four per cent retainable
by the Contractors (that is to say, a charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of four pounds for every one hundred pound Bond
issued).</p>

<p>After the Detailed Agreement referred to in Article
17 is settled, and pending the issue of the Loan, the
Contractors shall deposit the sum of fifty thousand
pounds with the issuing Bank to the Canton Chungking
Railway account, and this amount can be drawn
on by the Corporation for survey and other necessary
expenses authorized by the Managing Director against
certificates signed by the Chief Accountant and Chief
Engineer. This sum of fifty thousand pounds shall
bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum and
shall be refunded out of the proceeds of the Loan.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE VII</h3>

<p>The proceeds of the Loan shall be deposited with the
issuing Bank, to be nominated and guaranteed by the
Contractors, to the credit of a Canton Chungking Railway
Account on such terms as may be mutually
arranged in the Detailed Agreement referred to in
Article 17.</p>

<p>When the work of construction is ready to begin a
sum equal to the estimated expenditure in China for six
months shall be transferred to a Bank in China to be
mutually agreed upon and there placed to the credit of
a Canton Chungking Railway Account to be operated
upon by the Corporation under certificates signed by
the Chief Accountant and the Chief Engineer. This
amount of estimated expenditure for six months shall
be maintained by subsequent monthly transfers so that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
as far as possible, there shall always be six months
estimated expenditure in China on deposit in a Bank in
China to be mutually agreed upon.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE VIII</h3>

<p>Immediately after the signing of the Detailed Agreement,
the Corporation will establish a Head Office at
Canton for the Canton Chungking Railway. This
Office will be under the direction of a Chinese Managing
Director to be appointed by the Corporation, with
whom will be associated a British Engineer-in-Chief
and a British Firm of Public Accountants, of recognized
standing, whose representative shall be Chief
Accountant (hereinafter called "the Chief Accountant").
These British Employes shall be nominated by
the Corporation and the Contractors, jointly, and shall
be appointed by the Corporation. Their dismissal shall
take place, only, with the joint approval of the Corporation
and the Contractors.</p>

<p>It is understood that the duties to be performed by
these employes are intended to promote the mutual
interests of the Corporation and the Bondholders respectively,
and it is therefore agreed that all cases of
difference arising therefrom shall be referred for
amicable adjustment between the Corporation and the
Representative of the Contractors. The salaries and
other terms of Agreement of the Engineer-in-chief
and the Chief Accountant shall be arranged between
the Corporation and the Contractors; and the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>

operation of the Railway, Europeans of experience and
ability shall be engaged and wherever competent
Chinese are available, they shall be employed. All such
appointments shall be made, and their functions
defined, by the Managing Director and the Engineer-in-Chief
in consultation, and shall be submitted for the
approval of the Corporation; similar procedure shall
be followed in the case of Europeans employed in the
Chief Accountant's department. In the event of the
misconduct, or the incompetency of these European
employes, their services may be dispensed with by the
Managing Director, after consultation with the Engineer-in-Chief,
and subject to the sanction of the Corporation.
The form of Agreements made with these
European Employes shall conform to the usual
practice.</p>

does not include any purchases made for the Railway
after it has been completely constructed and equipped
and handed over ready for operation.</p>

<p>It is further clearly understood that the cost of land
purchased for the Railway, the salaries of the Managing
Director, Chief Accountants, Chief Engineer, and
the cost of their offices and staff shall not be included
in the meaning of the terms "construction and
equipment."</p>

<p>The Contractors shall have the option of constructing
on the same terms the proposed extension of the
Railway to Lanchow in the Province of Kansu, or a
Railway of similar mileage in some other part of China
to be mutually agreed upon, and this option shall
be for seven years from the commencement of
construction.</p>

<p>All other arrangements in connection with the construction
and equipment of the Railway shall be settled
in the Detailed Agreement referred to in Article 17.</p>

Dr. Sun Yat Sen,<br />
29 Rue Molière,<br />
Shanghai, Kiangsu.<br />
</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Sun</span>:</p>

<p>I have read with great interest your sketch project
for the international development of China as embodied
in your letter of February first to me. I congratulate
you upon the broad and statesmanlike
attitude with which you treat this very important subject.
Your suggestion of united international participation
in the development of China's resources deserves
the support of all friends of China. It would be
unfortunate indeed if the old régime of spheres of
influence, struggles for concessions and activities
flavoring of selfish exploitation should not, with the
conclusion of the war, be relegated to the past. You
are right in recognizing the necessity of a substitute
for the old order and your proposal of a unified policy
under international organization with Chinese participation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
for the larger development in China, naturally
assuming that the inalienable rights of the Chinese
people are to be amply safeguarded, meets this demand
admirably.</p>

<p>We are hopeful that conditions in China may become
such that the Chinese people themselves may be encouraged
to put their money into productive enterprise
and participate in the larger developments. We are
hopeful that the day is not far distant when the Chinese
Government may be able actively to interest itself in
the encouragement of native industry to the end that
native capital of which there is a very considerable
quantity, may be induced to lend itself to productive
enterprises, because of a Confidence in constructive
policy on the part of the government.</p>

<p>If you will permit a suggestion, I would be inclined
to reduce your admirable program to one which would
be in closer keeping with the limits of the present
world's resources in capital. As we all know devastated
Europe is calling for capital for rehabilitation
and other nations want capital for development programs
of considerable proportions. Thus it would
seem that China's program of development must of
necessity take cognizance of her most immediate and
most pressing needs. We are all united in that transportation
occupies a prominent place in such a program.
50,000 miles of railway and 100,000 miles of
good roads would seem to be sufficient to engage our
attention for any plans for the immediate future. This
would allow ample opportunity to penetrate the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
rich unoccupied regions in the North and West, which
should be opened to colonization and development as
soon as possible in order to relieve the economic
pressure of over population in sections along the coasts
and waterways, and to accord opportunities to bring
the rich regions of West China into contact with the
trade of the rest of China and the world at large.</p>

<p>Along with transportation, China needs to develop
its resources in iron and coal, the two great essentials
to modern industrialism. Arrangements should be
made whereby foreign capital can come to China's
assistance in these two important industries, but care
should be exercised so as to preserve to China the iron
and coal necessary for its own uses, and prevent
China's steel industry being mortgaged to foreign interests,
in a way so as to jeopardize China's future in
this important industry.</p>

<p>The reform of the currency and reforms in internal
tax administrations are questions of immediate importance
to China's economic and industrial development.</p>

<p>One of the greatest fields of potentiality in the
immediate demands of the New China, is agriculture.
The country depends in its final analysis upon the
prosperity of its agriculture. At present probably as
much as 80% of China's population is agricultural.
China's greatest problem is the proper feeding and
clothing of its vast population. Improved conditions
in agriculture, opening of new lands to cultivation,
irrigation and conservancy works, the encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
of the cattle and sheep industries, the development of
the cotton industry and the improvement of tea, silk
and the seed crops of China, are timely subjects in any
program of developments. There is a vast work to be
done in agriculture in China, which will lead to prosperity
generally, and make possible developments with
native capital in other fields of activity, whereas if
agricultural improvements are neglected, it will be
difficult to insure prosperity in other directions.</p>

<p>Thus for the present, I hope the main thought may
be centered on improvements in transportation, in
currency and tax administrations, in the development
of coal and iron industries, and in agriculture. Many
of the suggested activities included in your very
extensive program will follow as a corollary to the
above.</p>

<p>In thinking of all these developments, I believe that
we should always give thought to the fact that we are
not dealing with a new country but with one in which
social arrangements are exceedingly intricate and in
which a long-tested system of agricultural and industrial
organization exists. It is to my mind most important
that the transition to new methods of industry
and labor should not be sudden but that the old abilities
and values should be gradually transmuted. It is important
that the artistic ability existing in the silk and
porcelain manufacture, etc. should be maintained and
fostered, and not superseded by cheaper processes. It
is also highly important that no export of food should
be permitted, except as to clearly ascertained surpluses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of production. It would produce enormous suffering
were the food prices in China suddenly to be raised to
the world market level. The one factor in modern
organization which the Chinese must learn better to
understand is the corporation, and the fiduciary relationship
which the officers of the corporation ought
to occupy with respect to the stockholders. If the
Chinese cannot learn to use the corporation properly,
the organization of the national credit cannot be
effected. Here, too, it is necessary that the capital of
personal honesty which was accumulated under the old
system should not be lost but transferred to the new
methods of doing business. So at every point where
we are planning for a better and more efficient organization,
it seems necessary to hold on to the values
created in the past and not to disturb the entire balance
of society by too sudden changes.</p>

<p>I wish again to congratulate you upon the statesmanlike
view with which you consider the whole question
of the development of your country, and the very
timely suggestions you have to make in regard to a
united policy of international participation in these
developments. I am glad to note that the minds of the
leaders among the Chinese people today are being
centered more and more upon the constructive needs
of the country and efforts are being made to meet
these needs, in full appreciation of China's relations
with the people of other nations, to the end that China's
developments in the future may work in harmony with
the world developments generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
I should be glad to hear from you further and more
in detail concerning development plans.</p>

<p>Believe me, with the highest regard,</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Your Excellency</span>:</p>

<p>I have read with the greatest interest the project for
the International Development of China enclosed in
your letter of March 17th, and agree with you that the
economic development of China would be of the
greatest advantage, not only to China, but to the whole
of mankind.</p>

<p>The plans you propose, however, are so complex and
extensive that it will take many years to work them
out in detail. You doubtless are fully aware that it
would take billions of dollars to carry out even a small
portion of your proposals and that most of them would
not be able to pay interest charges and expenses of
operation for some years. The first question to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
decided, therefore, is how the interest charges on the
necessary loans could be met. The revenues of the
Chinese Republic are already too heavily burdened
with the interest charges on existing Government loans
to warrant further charges, and hence it would seem
necessary for the present to limit the projects for development
to those which seem sufficiently remunerative
to attract private capital. The government of the
United States has consistently endeavored to manifest
its disinterested friendship for the people of China and
will undoubtedly coöperate in every proper way in proposals
to advance their best interests.</p>

<p>Please accept my thanks for your kindness in submitting
your proposals.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Permit me as a professional railway man to express
my pleasure with your article appearing in the Far
Eastern Review for June.</p>

<p>I will not at this time express approval or disapproval
of the route which you have chosen but the idea of a
line to connect up the great agricultural interior with
the densely populated coast appeals to me strongly. I
feel that you are making a definite contribution to railway
economic theory in this respect, whereas the line
itself would relieve congestion, open up a production
area which would lower food costs, furnish employment
to large numbers of soldiers to be disbanded, and
put in circulation a large amount of hard money which
would go far to correct the currency situation.</p>

<p>I am especially pleased to have your article appear
at this time for I had already written one at the request
of the publishers of the forthcoming "Trans-Pacific"
magazine in which I touched upon the same line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
thought. This will not appear until July and your
opinions will have done much to prepare the minds of
sceptics upon the subject by that time.</p>

<p>I trust that this intrusion of an entire stranger may
be pardoned, and that you will continue to support
the thought which you have so ably presented.</p>

Dr. Sun Yat Sen,<br />

</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">My Dear Dr. Sun Yat Sen</span>:</p>

<p>I thank you for your very kind letter of June 19th
which has just been forwarded to me from my office
in Rome, also for your kindness in sending me your
splendid project "To assist the Re-adjustment of Post-bellum
Industries," and the program for "The International
Development of China."</p>

<p>I assure you I read your proposals and studied the
maps in connection with your able and logical argument
with the deepest interest. And I beg you to
accept my hearty congratulations.</p>

<p>I am entirely convinced that your noble <i>ideals will be</i>
realised, not only for the benefit of China and the
welfare of your own people, but for the benefit and
prosperity of the whole human race.</p>

<p>The Nations cannot continue to deny in the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
as they have in the past, the unlimited natural resources
of your rich fertile country, in foods, minerals, coal
and iron, etc.; and your plans for development and
activity, as well as your methods of communication for
expanding and cultivating almost untouched miles of
virgin soil, and bringing these products to the doors of
the "World Market" by a practical and economic plan,
scientifically studied out, places you at once among
the very rare few unselfish humanitarian benefactors,
and reveals so clearly your profound international
sympathies.</p>

<p>The development of China's natural resources will
give a new impetus and vitality to industry and commerce
in your country and will not only be of incalculable
benefit to your own people, but offer undeniable
and unlimited advantages to all people in all nations.
Therefore Governments and foreign financiers should
not hesitate in giving your plans their most careful
consideration and support, and come to your assistance
in the realisation of your grand humanitarian project.</p>

<p>The construction of a great "Northern Port" on the
Gulf of Pechili, and the building of a system of railways
from this great Northern Port to the northwestern
extremity of China, as well as the construction
of canals to connect the inland waterways systems of
North and Central China with the great "Northern
Port," and the development of coal and iron fields in
Shansi which would necessitate the construction of
iron and steel works would not only offer employment
to millions of your country people, but would open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
wider, and advantageously, the doors of thousands of
well organised industries in many nations.</p>

<p>It is very encouraging to me, dear Dr. Sun Yat Sen,
to know that you look upon my plans of an "International
World Centre of Communication" with favor,
and that you will further the idea among your countrymen
by writing about it in your magazine "The
Construction."</p>

<p>This city, erected upon neutral grounds would offer
at once the practical framework for the essential needs
of a League of Nations and could become its dignified
"Administrative Centre" crowned by an International
Court of Justice.</p>

<p>I have presented the plans and proposals of this
World Centre to the Rulers and governments of all
nations, and hope to be able to go to Washington in
October to exhibit the large original drawings and
personally explain the project from a practical and
economic point of view before the foreign delegates
who may meet there to assist in the formation of a
League of Nations, and I have written to President
Wilson, who after receiving the volumes containing the
proposals and plans, wrote that "he valued them very
highly."</p>

<p>I hope that in the very near future this International
World Centre of communication may become a reality.
It would be the means of clearly defining and bringing
into focus the highest natural products as well as the
most important industrial achievements of all countries.
This accomplishment would be one of the first definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
steps toward more friendly social and economic relations,
and the practicability of establishing such
coöperation cannot be disputed.</p>

<p>This City of Peace should rise and stand as an
International Monument, erected by international contribution
to commemorate the heroic struggle and noble
sacrifice of millions who gave their lives on the battle
fields, in the air and on the sea, that justice should
triumph and open the ways for humanity to progress
in peace, and free from tyranny in the future.</p>

<p>With the assurance, dear Dr. Sun Yat Sen, of my
most profound sympathies for your noble project, and
with my deep gratitude for your keen interest in my
plans,</p>

<p>I beg to remain, with high esteem</p>
